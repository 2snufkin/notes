## 1. Introduction to npm

### 1.1 What is npm?

npm, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, share, and manage packages of JavaScript code. These packages can be dependencies used in your projects, or standalone tools and libraries.

### 1.2 Installing npm

npm is included with Node.js, so when you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed. You can check the installed version of npm by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

### 1.3 npm Documentation

Refer to the official npm documentation for detailed information and updates: [npm Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/)

---

## 2. Common npm Commands

### 2.1 `npm init`

Initialize a new project by creating a `package.json` file. This file contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.

```bash
npm init
```

### 2.2 `npm install`

Install dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

```bash
npm install
```

### 2.3 `npm start`

Start the project as per the start script defined in the `package.json` file.

```bash
npm start
```

### 2.4 `npm test`

Run tests defined in the project.

```bash
npm test
```

### 2.5 `npm run`

Execute custom scripts defined in the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

```bash
npm run <script-name>
```

### 2.6 `npm publish`

Publish your package to the npm registry.

```bash
npm publish
```

---

## 3. Managing Dependencies

### 3.1 Installing Dependencies

To install a new dependency and save it to the `package.json` file:

```bash
npm install <package-name> --save
```

### 3.2 Updating Dependencies

Update dependencies based on the version specified in the `package.json` file.

```bash
npm update
```

### 3.3 Removing Dependencies

Remove a dependency and update the `package.json` file:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name> --save
```

### 3.4 Listing Dependencies

List installed dependencies and their versions:

```bash
npm list
```

### 3.5 Semantic Versioning

Understand and use semantic versioning when specifying dependencies in the `package.json` file.

---

## 4. npm Configuration

### 4.1 `npm config`

Set npm configuration options using the `config` command.

```bash
npm config set <key> <value>
```

### 4.2 `.npmrc` file

Use the `.npmrc` file to store npm configuration settings for a specific project.

---

## 5. Common Project Commands

### 5.1 `npm run build`

Execute the build script defined in the `package.json` file.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5.2 `npm run lint`

Run linting tools to check code quality.

```bash
npm run lint
```

### 5.3 `npm run test`

Run test scripts defined in the `package.json` file.

```bash
npm run test
```

---

## 6. Security with npm Audit

### 6.1 `npm audit`

npm Audit is a security feature that scans your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

```bash
npm audit
```

This command will provide information about vulnerabilities found in your project's dependencies, including severity levels and recommended actions.

### 6.2 `npm audit fix`

To automatically fix known vulnerabilities based on the audit report, you can use:

```bash
npm audit fix
```

This command will attempt to update your dependencies to versions that do not have the identified security issues. Keep in mind that it might not always be possible to automatically fix all vulnerabilities, and manual intervention may be required.

### 6.3 Best Practices for Security

- Regularly run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities.
- Keep your dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
- Review and understand the vulnerabilities reported before applying fixes.
- Consider using npm audit in your CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early.
