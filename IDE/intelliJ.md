# Configure schemes

In IntelliJ IDEA, code style settings are language-specific, so you need to configure them for every language that you use in your project separately. You can also copy the settings from one language and apply them to another language.
 Press Ctrl+Alt+S to open the IDE settings and select Editor | Code Style.

1. File | New Projects Setup | Settings for New Projects | Editor | Code Style.
2. Select the language for which you want to configure the code style.
3. Select the code style Scheme that you want to configure: the Project scheme or one of the IDE-level schemes.
