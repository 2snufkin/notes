# Redux 
Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions".
## Install
npm install react-redux@8
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
Install Redux DevTools (a browser addon): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en

Documentation: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/

## Project Structure
1. Create a store folder and inside it create:
2. store.js
3. for each slice of info you want to manage in the store, create a js file finish with the keyword "slice"

## Dictionary
**Slice:** A "slice" is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your app, typically defined together in a single file. The name comes from splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple "slices" of state.
**Action:** An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field. You can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application. An action object can have other fields with additional information about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field called payload.
**useSelector hook:** lets our component extract whatever pieces of data it needs from the Redux store state.
**useDispatch hook:** returns a reference to the dispatch function from the Redux store. You may use it to dispatch actions as needed.
**<Provider> component:** makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the Redux store.

# Creating a Store + Slice
## Slice
1. Create ‘slice’ for data with name, initialState and the object full of reducers functions
2. Get actions from slice.actions and export them
3. Export reducers

```js
const { createSlice } = require("@reduxjs/toolkit");

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name: "cart",
    initialState: {
        cartList: [],
        total: 0
    },
    reducers: {
        add(state, action){
            console.log(action.payload);
        },
        remove(){

        }
    }
});

export const { add, remove } = cartSlice.actions; // export methods to be used in the components
export const cartReducer = cartSlice.reducer; // export for the store
```
## Store
4. Import reducer inside store.js and register it
5. Export store
```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { cartReducer } from "./cartSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        cartState: cartReducer,
    }
});
```
6. Cover the entire application (index.js) with Provider with access to {store}
```js
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store/store"; // change the path if needed

//Other imports 
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Router>
        <App />
      </Router>
    </Provider>    
  </React.StrictMode>
);

```
# Use the Store
## Modify 
For modifing the state you need to call the methods that are defined in the slice inside the redcuers object
1. Import the actions (add/remove)
2. Use useDispatch so we can call actions (To change anything in store, we need to dispatch the action)
3. Use useSelector to get state information (cart/counter)

```js
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux"; // for modify the state
import { add, remove } from "../store/cartSlice"; 
import "./ProductCard.css";

export const ProductCard = ({product}) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch(); //return a dispatch function
  const {name, price, image} = product;

  return (
    <div className="productCard">
      <img src={image} alt={name} />
      <p className="name">{name}</p>
      <div className="action">
        <p>${price}</p>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(add(product))}>Add To Cart</button>  <-the product will be accesiable in the slice under action.playload->
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}


```
## Reading 
1. Import useSelector
2. Access the state attributes with useSelector

```js
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { useTitle } from "../hooks/useTitle";
import { CartCard } from "../components";

export const Cart = () => {
  useTitle("Cart");
  const products = useSelector(state => state.cartState.cartList); //cartState is the key of the reducer object inside store.js
  const total = useSelector(state => state.cartState.total);
  
  return (
    <main>
      <section className="cart">
        <h1>Cart Items: {products.length} / ${total}</h1>
        { products.map((product) => (
          <CartCard key={product.id} product={product} />
        )) }        
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}

```
