# React Router Introduction

React Router is a powerful library for handling navigation in React applications. It allows you to create a single-page application with multiple views, providing a smooth user experience without the need for full-page reloads. 

## React Router Setup
To get started with React Router, you need to install it in your project. 

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
Once installed, you can import the necessary components from `react-router-dom` to start using React Router in your application.


## Code
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './pages/Home';
....

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
    // navigation bar
    <nav>
        <Link to="/" end>Home</Link>
        <Link to="/<About />"><About /></Link>
        <Link to="/<Contact />"><Contact /></Link>
      </nav>

    <Routes>
      <Route end path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
      <Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

## Navigation

React Router provides several components for navigation, such as `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link`. Here's a basic example of how to set up navigation in your application:
Sure! Let's explain when to use each of the route components: `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link`.

1. `BrowserRouter`: The `BrowserRouter` component is a higher-level component that should wrap your entire application. Allows you to have clean URLs without the page refreshing when navigating between different views. You should use `BrowserRouter` at the top level of your application, usually in the main entry filelike `App.js` or `index.js`, to enable routing for the entire application. 

2. `Routes` and `Routes`: `<Routes>` wrap all the `<Route>` tags. The `Route` component is used to define the mapping between a specific URL path and the component you want to render when that path is matched. It plays a crucial role in determining which component should be displayed based on the current URL. The <Route> is evaluated top to button. if the url does not match the first <Route> we try to match it to the second, if not - to the third etc..

3. `Link` and `NavLink`:

+ `Link`: used to create navigation links within your application. When a user clicks on a `Link`, it triggers a client-side navigation without a full page reload. This allows for a smoother user experience compared to traditional anchor tags (`<a>`) which would cause a page reload .

+ `NavLink`: a special version of the Link component that adds extra props and styles to the rendered element when it matches the current URL. It add an active class automaticaly. But it can cause an unexpected behvior if you use `to="/"` since the `/` maches every route (it is included in evrey to). In this case The  `<Link to="/" >Home</Link>` will have the class active even if you navigate to another link. The solution is to use end attribute.\

### end
The end attribute (before version 5.0 it was `exact`) is a boolean prop used with NavLink to control whether the styles and props should be applied only when the NavLink matches the exact URL or also when it partially matches the URL.
Here's an example of how to use `Link` components:


##  `<Navigate>` and `useNavigate`

React Router provides two ways to programmatically navigate between different views or pages in a React application: using the `<Navigate>` component and the `useNavigate` hook. Use useNavigate() inside functions and <Navigate> inside the jsx component

+ `<Navigate>` Component: It replaces the rendered component based on a specific condition. The primary use case for `<Navigate>` is to handle redirects and conditional navigation logic.

```jsx
import { Navigate, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  const isLoggedIn = false; // Replace with your authentication logic

  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route exact path="/">
        {isLoggedIn ? <Navigate to="/dashboard" /> : <Home />}
      </Route>
      <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```
In this example, if the user is logged in (`isLoggedIn === true`), they will be redirected to the `/dashboard` page using the `<Navigate>` component. Otherwise, the `Home` component will be rendered.

+ `useNavigate` Hook: The `useNavigate` hook provides an imperative way to navigate within your functional components. It gives you a function that you can call to change the current URL programmatically. It is generally used when you need to perform navigation based on user interactions or certain events.

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function LoginButton() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleLogin = () => {
    // Replace this with your login logic
    // Once the user is logged in successfully, navigate to the dashboard
    navigate('/dashboard');
  };

  return <button onClick={handleLogin}>Log In</button>;
}
```

In this example, when the user clicks the "Log In" button, the `handleLogin` function will be called, and it will use the `navigate` function from the `useNavigate` hook to redirect the user to the `/dashboard` page.


## Route Parameters

Route parameters allow you to pass dynamic values in the URL and extract them in the rendered components. To define a route parameter, use a colon followed by the parameter name in the path attribute of the Route component. Here's an example:

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import BlogPost from './pages/BlogPost';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      ...
      <Route path="/blog/:id" element={<BlogPost />} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## useParams: Acessing route params
The `BlogPost` component can access the `id` parameter using:
1. `props.match.params.id`. This way, you can dynamically render content based on the route parameters.
2. useParams() : 
```jsx
import {useParams} from "react-router-dom";
...
//param is an object with key-value
const param = usePrams();
//you can access a param by its key
const id = param["id"]

```

## useSearchParams: Acessing query params
Query parameters, also known as query strings, are used to pass data as key-value pairs in the URL after a question mark (?). They are typically used to provide additional information to a server or to filter, sort, or paginate data.
To access them:
```jsx
import {useSearchParams} from "react-router-dom";
...
  let [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

//you can access a search param value as string by its key (https://example.com/search?q=keyword&page=2)
const pageNo = searchParams.get("page")  //2

```
## useLocation: Acessing everything
`useLocation()` is a hook provided by React Router that allows you to access the current location information within your functional components. It returns an object with attributes representing different parts of the current URL.

Example usage of `useLocation()`:

```jsx
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const location = useLocation();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Current Location:</h2>
      <p>Pathname: {location.pathname}</p>
      <p>Search: {location.search}</p>
      <p>Hash: {location.hash}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
The `location` object returned by `useLocation()` contains the current location information, including the `pathname`, `search`, and `hash`. 
for this url: `.../products?category=shoes?sort=true#details`
```json
{
  "pathname": "/products",
  "key": "default"
  "state": null
  "search": "?category=shoes?sort=true",
  "hash": "#details"
}
```
1. `pathname`: Represents the current path of the URL. It is a string that includes the path after the domain name and before the query string and hash.

2. `search`: Represents the query string of the URL. It is a string that includes the `?` character followed by key-value pairs separated by `&`.

3. `hash`: Represents the hash fragment of the URL. It is a string that includes the `#` character followed by the hash value.


## 404: No Route Found
To handle cases where the user navigates to a non-existent route, you can set up a "404 Not Found" page. To do this, simply define a `Route` component without a `path` prop or with `path="*"` at the end of your `BrowserRouter`. This route will be matched when no other route is found.

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import NotFound from './pages/NotFound';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
        ....
      <Route path="*" element={NotFound} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Nested Routes

React Router also allows you to create nested routes, which are useful for building complex user interfaces. You can nest `Route` components within other components to achieve this. Here's an example:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
   //...header
      <Routes>
        <Route index element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="home" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="user" element={<User />}>
        // nested routes: user/profile and user/account. the path is relative
          <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
          <Route path="account" element={<Account />} />
        </Route>
        <Route path="*" element={<NoMatch />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
};

```
When clicking on user you will see the User component. When clicking on user/profile you will see the User component and the Profile component nested inside it. How will React know where to inject the nested component? It doesn't. You should unclude a placholer in the form of   <Outlet />
+ **Outlet:** a placeholder where the content of nested routes can be rendered.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

const User = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Page</h2>
      {/* This is the outlet where the nested routes will be rendered */}
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

export default User;

```
In the above code, we import the `Outlet` component from `react-router-dom` and place it inside the User component. This outlet will be replaced by the content of the nested routes (e.g., `Profile` and `Account`) defined within the User component in the parent component (App).
