# JSON Server
you develop your front but the API is not ready, use JSON server library. You will get full fake REST API with zero coding
1. install : `npm install -g json-server`. If you install it globally you woin't see it in the package.json
2. create a db.json file in your project. it will be accesible via "http://localhost:3000/posts/1" for example
```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" },
    { "id": 2, "title": "json-backend", "author": "flash" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "typicode" }
}
```
3. run the server `json-server --watch db.json --port 8003`.\
If you put the json file inside a folder, change the path.\
the port is not a must but since React listen on the 3000 port, you should change it

4. test that it works fine. Go to "http://localhost:8003/posts/1" and check that you get the requested data
5. change the prot of the backend server since react also listen on the same port
5. change the json file content for your needs
