# Why We Need States?
state: the current value of a specific variable.
Without useState, we change the data but it isn't reflected on the page.\
with useState: React will monitor the variable and whenever it changes, the element that contains the variable will be rendered - not all the component.

# State Introduction: useState
it's a hook function you should import from react. When you call it it will returns an array with 2 values:
1. state: current state
2. setState: a function how to update the state

use destructring to access them 
`const [count, setCount] = useState(inital_value);`

# useState: Multiple Updates
the state will stay constant unless you pass a function to the setter
supose that age == 42 clicking on the button will set the age to 42 even thought the setAge is called 3 times
```js
function handleClick() {
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
}
```
When passing a function, React guarantees that the function will receive the latest state as its argument. 
```js
   const addOne = () => {
        setAge( a  =>  a+ 1) //43
        setAge( a  =>  a + 1) //44 
        setAge( a  =>  a + 1) //45
    }
