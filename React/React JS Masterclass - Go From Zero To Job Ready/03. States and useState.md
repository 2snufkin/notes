# Why We Need States?
state: the current value of a specific variable.
Without useState, we change the data but it isn't reflected on the page.\
with useState: React will monitor the variable and whenever it changes, the element that contains the variable will be rendered - not all the component.

# State Introduction: useState
it's a hook function you should import from react. When you call it it will returns an array with 2 values:
1. state: current state
2. setState: a function how to update the state

use destructring to access them 
`const [count, setCount] = useState(inital_value);`

# useState: Multiple Updates
the state will stay constant unless you pass a function to the setter
supose that age == 42 clicking on the button will set the age to 42 even thought the setAge is called 3 times
```js
function handleClick() {
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
}
```
When passing a function, React guarantees that the function will receive the latest state as its argument. 
```js
   const addOne = () => {
        setAge( a  =>  a+ 1) //43
        setAge( a  =>  a + 1) //44 
        setAge( a  =>  a + 1) //45
    }

```
# useState: Array setState Value
you pass the setState an updated version of the list. You can do it with calling the filter method on the inital list


# Conditional Templates
+ Use conditions to diplay/hide elements
```jsx

  let paragraph = null;
  if (condition) {
    paragraph = <p>This paragraph is rendered conditionally.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {paragraph}
    </div>
  );

```
+ tenetray opertors to return diffrent element/class according to a condition: 
```jsx

  <div>
      {condition ? <p>This paragraph is rendered conditionally.</p> : null}
    </div>`
```

# Quick Hook Advice
1. definde them at the top of the component. 
2. You can't use/define them outside the component scope

# Global State Management using `useState` in the App Component

When used at the App component level, it becomes a form of global state management, allowing you to share and modify state across different parts of your application.

## When to Use Global State with `useState`?

Global state management using `useState` is beneficial in the following scenarios:

1. **Application-Wide Data Sharing:** When you have data that needs to be shared among multiple components throughout your application, using global state with `useState` can simplify data access and updates.

2. **Complex State Handling:** For applications with complex state interactions, managing state at the App component level can help centralize logic and make it easier to reason about the overall state changes.

3. **Avoiding Prop Drilling:** As your application grows, passing props down multiple levels of nested components (prop drilling) can become cumbersome. Global state provides a cleaner alternative, making the data directly accessible to any component that needs it.

4. **Simplifying Communication between Components:** In cases where sibling components need to communicate or share data, global state can serve as a communication channel, reducing the need for complex event handling or prop passing.

## Alternatives to Global State with `useState`

While `useState` provides a simple way to manage global state within the App component, there are alternative state management solutions that might be more suitable for larger or more complex applications. Some popular alternatives include:

1. **Redux:** Redux is a state management library that helps manage application-wide state in a predictable and centralized manner. It provides a global store that holds the entire state of the application, and components can access and modify this state using actions and reducers.

2. **MobX:** MobX is another state management library that offers a more flexible approach to managing state. It allows you to create observable objects that automatically update components when the state changes.

3. **Context API:** The Context API is a built-in feature of React that enables you to create a global state container accessible to all components within a specific part of your application. While not as powerful as Redux, it can be sufficient for managing simpler global state needs.

4. **GraphQL with Apollo Client:** For applications with complex data requirements, using GraphQL with Apollo Client can provide a robust solution for managing global state. Apollo Client allows you to fetch and manage data from various sources while caching and distributing it efficiently to components.

## Choosing the Right Global State Management Approach

The choice of global state management approach depends on the complexity and size of your application, as well as your team's familiarity with different libraries and patterns. For smaller applications with limited state interactions, using `useState` at the App component level might be sufficient. However, as your application grows, and state management becomes more intricate, considering more sophisticated solutions like Redux, MobX, or Context API is recommended to maintain a scalable and maintainable codebase.
