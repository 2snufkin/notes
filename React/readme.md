# Introduction 
a JS library for building UI 
JS let us run logic in the browser , it manipulate the DOM, the HTML structure of the page without fetching a new HTML. No request to the server, no need to wait for a new HTML.
React has the SPA approch: server only send one HTML page and react controls the UI.
Lean: if you want to add functionallity like routing, state managment etc...you should install 3rd partie libraries

# Why React and not just JS?
## JS way
a simple action demande a lot of JS code. select elements with querySelector, adding event listener, assigning classname, creating elements dynamically, assigning text content etc...
this is the imperetive approch : describing step after step. Low level code  + re-inventing the wheel over and over again and doing reptitive tasks.

## React way
you can have custom HTML elements. you split your app into small components, much more easy to maintain and debug, and react is doing the heavy lifting. The aproche is not imperative  but declaretive code. we say what we want to present and react do the rest for us -  it's a high level, component based code.
