# Folder Structure and Component Organization Guide

When developing a React project, organizing your components into meaningful folders can significantly improve maintainability and scalability. In this guide, we'll explore the role of each folder and provide examples to help you decide where to put new components.

## 1. common

### Role:
The `common` folder is meant for housing components that are generic and can be reused across different parts of your application. These components usually don't have a direct relationship with specific features but serve as utility components.

### Examples:
- **Button**: A reusable component that renders different types of buttons (primary, secondary, etc.).
- **Input**: A component for text input fields with validation and error handling.
- **Alert**: A component for displaying alert messages.

## 2. features

### Role:
The `features` folder contains components that are closely related to specific features or sections of your application. Each feature may have its own folder within `features`, making it easier to locate and maintain components.

### Examples:
- **UserDashboard**: A component that displays the main dashboard for the user feature.
- **ProductList**: A component responsible for rendering a list of products on the product feature page.
- **ContactForm**: A component that represents the contact form feature of your application.

## 3. layout

### Role:
The `layout` folder is used for components related to the overall layout and structure of your application. These components define the common structure and arrangement of elements throughout your app.

### Examples:
- **Header**: A component for the header section of your application with navigation links.
- **Footer**: A component that renders the footer section, including copyright information.
- **Sidebar**: A component that displays a sidebar menu for navigation.

## 4. shared

### Role:
The `shared` folder is meant for components that can be shared across different parts of your application, but they are not generic utility components like those in the `common` folder. These components are shared among various features.

### Examples:
- **Modal**: A reusable modal component that can be used in different parts of your app.
- **LoadingSpinner**: A loading spinner component to show loading states across features.
- **ErrorBoundary**: A component that catches errors and displays a fallback UI.

By organizing your components into these folders, you can easily locate and manage your components as your project grows. When creating a new component, consider its nature and purpose to decide which folder it fits best. If it's a generic, reusable component, place it in the `common` folder. If it's closely related to a specific feature, use the `features` folder. If it affects the overall layout, choose the `layout` folder, and if it's something that can be shared, but not generic, use the `shared` folder.

Remember, these folder names are not strict conventions, and you can adjust them based on your project's needs. The most important thing is to maintain a logical organization that makes sense to you and your team. Happy coding!
