# Pages

The `pages` folder contains the main views or screens of your application. Each page typically represents a distinct section of your app.

## Role
This folder houses the high-level components that define the main screens or views of your application.

## Files
- `HomePage.js`: Example of a main page component.
- `AboutPage.js`: Another example of a main page component.

## Example
If you have a homepage and an about page in your application, you would create the corresponding `HomePage.js` and `AboutPage.js` files inside the `pages/` folder.
