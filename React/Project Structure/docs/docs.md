# Docs

The `docs` folder contains documentation related to your React project, including user guides, API documentation, and any other relevant documentation.

## Role
This folder is used to store various documentation files that provide information about your application's functionality, usage, and architecture.

## Files
- `user-guide.md`: Example of a user guide explaining how to use your application.
- `api-documentation.md`: Example of documentation for your application's API.
- `architecture.md`: Example of documentation describing the high-level architecture of your application.

## Example
If you have a user guide for explaining how users can interact with your application and an API documentation file to detail how developers can use your application's APIs, you would place these files like `user-guide.md` and `api-documentation.md` inside the `docs/` folder.

Feel free to adapt these explanations and examples based on the type of documentation you want to include in your "docs" folder. Clear and well-organized documentation is essential for maintaining and collaborating on any project.
