# Tests

The `tests` folder holds test files for your React components and other code. This helps ensure the reliability and correctness of your application.

## Role
This folder is used to organize and store test files that verify the functionality of your application's code.

### Files
- `Component1.test.js`: Example of a test file for a component.
- `ApiService.test.js`: Example of a test file for an API service.

## Example
If you have a `Button` component and an `ApiService` that need to be tested, you would place corresponding test files like `Button.test.js` and `ApiService.test.js` inside the `tests/` folder.
