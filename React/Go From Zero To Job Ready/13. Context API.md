# Context API

In React, context and reducers are powerful tools for managing global state and complex state logic. Till now you manage the state on the component level. Using contexte will let any compoent access to the global state. A component can change the state using reducers.

## Definitions

- **Context**: A React API that enables the passing of information to child components without relying solely on props (avoiding prop drilling)

- **Reducer**: A pure function that takes a state and an action as input and produces a new state as output.

- **Action**: An object literal describing a state change. 

- **useContext**: A React hook that allows functional components to consume values from context.

- **useReducer**: A React hook often used for managing complex state, serving as an alternative to `useState`.

- **dispatch**: A function returned by `useReducer` for sending action objects to the reducer function.


## Context 
What you should find in the context js/ts file:
  - Initialization of the global state and its default values.
  - Creation of the context with createContext(init_state)
  - Definition of the main context provider.
  - Definition of actions and functions to modify the state.
  - Export of the context and its provider for use in other parts of the application.

## use the context
for using the context in your app, you must
 - make sure that you component (or its parent) is warp with the context's Provider
 ```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { CartProvider } from './context/CartContext';
import CartCard from './components/CartCard';

function App() {
  return (
    <CartProvider>
      {/* Your app content */}
      <CartCard />
    </CartProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
 - you use useContext() or useCustomName() 

```jsx
// CartCard.js
import React from 'react';
import { useCart } from '../context/CartContext';

function CartCard() {
  const { state, addToCart } = useCart();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render cart items and handle actions */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default CartCard;
```

## Reducer
  - Definition of the initial state and data structure.
  - A switch statement that handles different action types and modifies the state accordingly.
  - Export of the reducer function for use with the Context API.
  
In React, reducers play a crucial role in managing and updating application state in a controlled and predictable manner. To understand reducers, it's essential to know the components of a typical action object, which is used in conjunction with reducers.

### Action Object

An action object in React consists of three main properties:

1. **Type**: The `type` property is a string or symbol that uniquely identifies the action to be performed. Conventionally, action types are defined as constants to ensure consistency and prevent typos.

2. **Payload**: The `payload` property is optional but frequently used to carry data related to the action. It can be of any data type (e.g., object, string, number) and contains the information necessary to update the state based on the action.

3. **Meta**: The `meta` property is also optional and is typically used for additional metadata or non-state-related information about the action. This property can provide context or extra details about the action.

### Reducer Function

A reducer function is responsible for handling actions and updating the application state accordingly. It follows a predictable pattern and takes two parameters:

- `state`: The current state of the application.
- `action`: An action object describing the action to be performed.

Inside the reducer function, a `switch` statement is often used to examine the `type` property of the action to determine how to update the state. Here's a simplified and organized example of a reducer:

```javascript
// context/cartReducer.js

// Define the initial state
const initialState = {
  cartItems: [],   // An array to store items in the cart
  total: 0,        // The total cost of items in the cart
};

const cartReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const { type, payload } = action;

  switch (type) {
    case 'ADD_TO_CART':
      // Implement logic to add an item to the cart and update the total
      const updatedCart = [...state.cartItems, payload]; // Add the item to the cart
      const updatedTotal = state.total + payload.price;   // Update the total cost
      return { ...state, cartItems: updatedCart, total: updatedTotal };

    // Implement other cases for different actions

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default cartReducer;
```


- We start by defining the initial state, which includes properties like `cartItems` (an array to store items in the cart) and `total` (the total cost of items in the cart).

- The reducer function receives the current `state` and an `action` as parameters.

- Inside the `switch` statement, we handle the `ADD_TO_CART` action by updating the `cartItems` and `total` properties in a clear and structured manner.

Reducers in React follow this pattern, making it easy to manage and update application state based on various actions. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability, making it more comprehensible and organized.

`useReducer` is valuable for handling complex state logic by dispatching actions and updating the global state accordingly.
