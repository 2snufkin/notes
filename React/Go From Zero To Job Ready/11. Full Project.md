# Cinemate Demo

This document serves as a general guide to building a React project from scratch. 

## Project Setup
1. Create a new React app using Create React App.
```bash
npx create-react-app cinemate-demo
cd cinemate-demo
```
2. Install required dependencies.
```bash
npm install axios tailwindcss flowbite react-router-dom
```

## Tailwind Introduction / 063
In this section, we'll introduce Tailwind CSS and set it up for our project.
1. Create a Tailwind CSS configuration file.
```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

2. Customize the Tailwind CSS configuration as needed.
3. Create a `styles.css` file and import Tailwind CSS styles.
```css
/* src/styles.css */
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```
4. Import `styles.css` into your `index.js` file.
```jsx
// src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './styles.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## API:
If you work with an API

1. Go to the website and sign up for an API key.
2. Use the API key to make requests.

## UI Implementation

Write your components

## Navigation Structure

1. Define the routes and navigation links in the `App.js` file.

```jsx
// src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import MovieList from './components/MovieList';
import MovieDetails from './components/MovieDetails';
import NotFound from './components/NotFound';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route exact path="/movies" component={MovieList} />
        <Route path="/movies/:id" component={MovieDetails} />
        <Route component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Dark Mode Integration 

Let's add dark mode support to our application.

1. Create a `DarkModeToggle` component to handle dark mode state and toggling.
2. Use React context or Redux to manage the dark mode state globally.
3. Apply dark mode styles to the components.

## Connect to the API

1. Use the `useFetch` custom hook to fetch data from the  API.

2. Render the list of movies with appropriate UI.


```jsx
// src/hooks/useFetch.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const useFetch = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(url);
        setData(response.data);
        setIsLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, isLoading, error };
};

export default useFetch;
```

## Custom Hook: useFetch 

Now, let's use the `useFetch` custom hook to fetch data for the movie list page.

```jsx
// src/components/MovieList.js
import React from 'react';
import useFetch from '../hooks/useFetch';

const MovieList = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useFetch('API_URL_FOR_MOVIE_LIST');

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  // Render the list of movies using data.

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Movie list rendering */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MovieList;
```

## API Fetch: Movie Search 

Next, we'll implement the movie search functionality.

1. Create a `SearchBar` component to handle user input for searching movies.

2. Fetch the search results from the TMDB API using the `useFetch` custom hook.

3. Display the search results.

## Tailwind CSS Customization / 072

In this section, we'll customize the Tailwind CSS styles to match the project's design.

1. Update the Tailwind CSS configuration as needed.

2. Override default styles using custom CSS classes.

## Page Not Found / 073

Let's create a 404 Not Found page to handle invalid routes.

1. Create a `NotFound` component to display a friendly error message.

2. Update the navigation structure to redirect to the `NotFound` component for invalid routes.

## Individual Movie Information / 074

In this section, we'll implement the movie details page.

1. Create a `MovieDetails` component to fetch and display individual movie information.

2. Use the `useFetch` custom hook to fetch data for the specific movie.

3. Display detailed movie information.

## Scroll Restoration: Scroll to Top / 075

We'll add scroll restoration to ensure the page scrolls to the top when navigating between pages.

1. Use `React Router` to enable scroll restoration.

2. Scroll to the top of the page on route changes.

## Dynamic Page Title / 076

Let's make the page title dynamic based on the current page or movie being viewed.

1. Update the page title using `React Helmet` or a similar library.

2. Set appropriate titles for different pages.

## Style Update / 077

In this section, we'll make some style updates to improve the overall look and feel of the application.

1. Refine the UI design based on feedback and preferences.

## Project Deployment / 078

Now, it's time to deploy our project.

1. Choose a hosting platform for deployment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

2. Configure the deployment settings and deploy the application.

## Development Branch on Git and GitHub

In this section, we'll cover version control with Git and GitHub.

## Project Deployment / 078

Now that our application is ready, it's time to deploy it to make it accessible to the public.

1. Choose a Hosting Platform:
   Select a hosting platform that best suits your project's needs. Popular options include Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, and Heroku.

2. Build the Project:
   Before deployment, create a production build of your React app. This step optimizes the code and assets for better performance.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Deploy to Netlify:
   For Netlify deployment, follow these steps:

   - Sign up for a Netlify account if you haven't already.
   - Connect your Netlify account to your GitHub repository.
   - Choose the repository and branch you want to deploy.
   - Configure the build settings (build command: `npm run build`, publish directory: `build`).
   - Click on the "Deploy" button to trigger the deployment process.
   - Once the deployment is successful, you will get a unique URL for your application.

4. Deploy to Other Platforms:
   If you choose a different hosting platform, refer to their documentation for specific deployment instructions. Generally, you'll need to specify the build command and the directory where the build files are located.

## Development Branch on Git and GitHub

To manage changes and collaborate with other developers, it's essential to use version control. Let's create a development branch on Git and GitHub.

1. Initialize Git:
   If you haven't already, initialize Git in your project's root directory.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Create a Development Branch:
   It's a best practice to work on new features and bug fixes in separate branches to keep the main branch (`main` or `master`) clean and stable. Create a new branch named `development` and switch to it.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b development
   ```

3. Commit and Push Changes:
   Make your changes, commit them, and push the `development` branch to the remote repository (GitHub).

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin development
   ```

4. Pull Requests:
   When you're ready to merge your changes into the main branch, create a pull request on GitHub. This allows other team members to review your changes before merging them.

   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on "Pull Requests" and then "New Pull Request."
   - Select the `development` branch as the source and the `main` (or `master`) branch as the target.
   - Review the changes and click "Create Pull Request."
   - Request a review from a team member, and once approved, merge the changes into the main branch.

## Solved: Netlify Error / 079

If you encounter issues during deployment on Netlify, follow these common troubleshooting steps:

1. Check Build Logs:
   Go to your Netlify dashboard and navigate to the "Deploys" section. Check the build logs for any error messages or warnings. This will give you insights into what went wrong during the build process.

2. Verify Build Settings:
   Ensure that you have set the correct build command (`npm run build`) and publish directory (`build`) in the Netlify configuration.

3. Environment Variables:
   If your project relies on environment variables, make sure they are correctly set in your Netlify project settings.

4. Dependency Issues:
   Check if your project has any dependencies that might be causing conflicts during the build process. Make sure you have specified the correct versions of packages in your `package.json` file.

5. Clear Cache and Retry:
   Sometimes, cached files may cause issues during deployment. Try clearing the cache and redeploying the project.

6. Read Netlify Documentation:
   Refer to Netlify's official documentation and community forums for specific error troubleshooting and solutions.

By following these steps, you can deploy your React project successfully and collaborate effectively with other developers using version control.
