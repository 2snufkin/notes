# The Complete SQL Bootcamp for Aspiring Data Scientists 
# What's inside
1. The fundamentals, covering SQL syntax, data types, and essential querying techniques. 
2. How to write powerful SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and sort data, as well as perform calculations, and leverage aggregate functions.
3. Advanced SQL for data science. Joining tables, using subqueries, and employing window functions are vital skills for complex data retrieval and analysis. 
4. How to combine data from multiple tables, create intricate queries, and extract valuable insights from large datasets.
5. Database management and optimization. You will gain the skills to efficiently manage SQL Server databases, including database design, indexing, and performance tuning. 
This knowledge is crucial for ensuring that your databases run smoothly and deliver optimal performance. By the end of this course, you will have gained the confidence and expertise to utilize SQL for data science tasks, ranging from data exploration and manipulation to advanced analytics and reporting.


Database: Collection of tables and objects such as views, indexes stored procedures and triggers.
DBMS: Database Management System 
1. SQL (Relational) : MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL...    
2. NoSQL (Non Relational): MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.. 
SQL: Structured Query Language. QUery language for CRUDing data stored in relation DB
Downloed. Declarative (what you want) not procederal (how it will be done)
### MS SQL Server: has master, model, mddb and tempdb
+ master: stores server-specific configuration information and authorized user details
+ model: a template for creating new databases by providing initial content
+ msdb:  manages SQL Server Agent configurations and job history
+ tempdb: temporary storage of tables, indexes, and result sets during query processing.
New DB: that db file that contains the db object is created and also a log file that records all the modification that happens in the db and the trunsactions that causes them.  

## SQL Syntax
SQL commend start with a verb + direct object. The verb instructs the system to perform an action, and the direct object specifies what. 
Comments: one line comment start with `--`  and multi line with `/* ... */`

## Data Types
It's important to note that the syntax and availability of these data types may vary slightly among different database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others. Always refer to the documentation of the specific DBMS you are using for precise information on data types and their usage.

1. **Numeric Types:**
   - `INT` or `INTEGER`: Integer.
   - `SMALLINT`: Small integer.
   - `TINYINT`: Tiny integer. 0 - 255
   - `BIGINT`: Big integer.
   - `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC`: Fixed-point number.
   - `FLOAT`: Floating-point number.
   - `REAL`: Real number.
   - `DOUBLE PRECISION`: Double-precision floating-point number.

2. **Character String Types:**
   - `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length character string.
   - `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length character string.
   - `TEXT`: Variable-length character string (no specified length).

3. **Date and Time Types:**
   - `DATE`: Date (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - `TIME`: Time (HH:MM:SS).
   - `TIMESTAMP`: Date and time combination.
   - `INTERVAL`: A period of time.

4. **Boolean Type:**
   - `BOOLEAN` or `BOOL`: Represents true or false values.

5. **Binary Types:**
   - `BINARY(n)`: Fixed-length binary string.
   - `VARBINARY(n)`: Variable-length binary string.
   - `BLOB`: Binary large object (for large binary data).

6. **Miscellaneous Types:**
   - `ENUM`: Enumeration of values.
   - `SET`: Set of values.
   - `JSON`: JSON data.

7. **Spatial Types (for Geographic Information Systems):**
   - `GEOMETRY`, `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `POLYGON`, etc.

8. **Specialized Types (Database-specific):**
   - Various databases may have additional specialized data types specific to their features and requirements.



## DDL: Data Definition Language
DDL:Commends that alter the structure of the DB or table: Create, Drop, Alter, Truncate
AutoGenerated ID: 
```SQL

-- Create a DB
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
-- Change DB Name
ALTER DATABASE current_name MODIFY NAME = new_name;
-- Delete a DB
DROP DATABASE database_name;
-- Create a Table with auto generated ID: the data type should be one of the numeric, the seed is the first id that will generated
(
	column_id_name       data_type(seed, incrememnt)   NOT NULL,
	column_name          data_type                     NULL/NOT NULL,
	....
)
-- Create a Table: you need the columnds names, data type each column accepts and wheater it can be Null (Optional)
CREATE TABLE table_name
(
	column_name          data_type 						NULL/NOT NULL,
	....
)
```

# DML: Data Manipulation Language
DML: Manipulation of existing records in the DB. Select, Insert,  Update, Delete
```SQL

-- Insert into a Table: INSERT == INSERT INTO
INSERT table_name VALUES (value_col1, value_col2, ...);
-- Insert into a Table: only to certains columns
INSERT table_name(column_name1,column_name4) VALUES	(value_col1, value_col4);
-- Alter the type of a certain column
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name data_type;
-- Alter the type of a certain column and make it not null
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name data_type NOT NULL;
```
