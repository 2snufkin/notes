Database: Collection of tables and objects such as views, indexes stored procedures and triggers.
DBMS: Database Management System 
1. SQL (Relational) : MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL...    
2. NoSQL (Non Relational): MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.. 
SQL: Structured Query Language. QUery language for CRUDing data stored in relation DB
Downloed. Declarative (what you want) not procederal (how it will be done)
### MS SQL Server: has master, model, mddb and tempdb
+ master: stores server-specific configuration information and authorized user details
+ model: a template for creating new databases by providing initial content
+ msdb:  manages SQL Server Agent configurations and job history
+ tempdb: temporary storage of tables, indexes, and result sets during query processing.
New DB: that db file that contains the db object is created and also a log file that records all the modification that happens in the db and the trunsactions that causes them.  


## DDL: Data Definition Language
DDL:Commends that alter the structure of the DB or table: Create, Drop, Alter, Truncate

# DML: Data Manipulation Language
DML: Manipulation of existing records in the DB. Select, Insert,  Update, Delete
