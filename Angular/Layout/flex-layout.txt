Installing
**********

add to imports: FlexLayoutModule

API
***
there is static API and reactive API
StaticAPI: doesn't take in consideration responsivness, reacting to diffrent screen sizes
Reactive: react to diffrent screen size. Does not contains directives but count on the existing StaticAPI


STATIC API:
***********
fxLayout: define the container as flexbox
fxFlex: the container take all avaliable width (for row) and not only the min. width nesscery for it's components
fxLayoutAlign:  define the aligment of the elements. the first arg is along the axis, the second arg is the cross axis (axis == x or y)
	won't work?: to center along the y axis make sure that the element you want to center has a highet (try 100%) and to canter along the x axis make sure it has a defined width. En plus, it will center it in realtion to the warping element not in realtion to the page

fxLayoutGap: define the padding between one children and another.

for Elements:
fxFlex: used on elements within a fxLayout container and identifies the resizing of that element within the flexbox container flow. Can be use also on a container
fxFlex="120px": will define it as a flex and will give it a width

RESPONSIVE API:
***************
in this examples I will use small devices ==xs as example. Replace it with the device code that serve your purpose

hide element on a small devices: fxHide.xs
hide elemnet of the screen is greater than xs: fxHide.gt-xs
show elemenet of the screen is lesser than md: fxHide.lt-md
