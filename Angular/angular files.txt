##Files
environement.ts:app wide properties: config setting, URL, etc
the environement object sould have the same structure (attributes, keys) and properties in all environements files
use it: for getting access to it's values you need to import the object
`import {environment} from "../environments/environment";
 `
in the dev mode angular will take the valu from the enviroment.ts file and in prod mode from the enviroment-prod files
