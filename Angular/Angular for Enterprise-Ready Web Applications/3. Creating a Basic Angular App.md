# Conception
1. you need a platform for task/tickets management:   YouTrack, github project, jira etc...the one that resemble the moat a Kanban board is git project
2. Wireframe design: grab a pencil and paper and sketch each view of the app
3. Architecture:You should practice hard-decoupling, which means front-end code lives in a separate repository, never calls the database directly, and is hosted on its web server altogether. This way, you can be sure that, at all times, your REST APIs or your front-end code is entirely replaceable and independent of other code.
