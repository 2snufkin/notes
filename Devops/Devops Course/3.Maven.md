# Introduction to Maven
- Maven streamlines project management tasks and simplifies dependency handling for Java projects. DevOps engineers also utilize Maven in their work.
- This section focuses on understanding and utilizing Maven specifically from a DevOps engineer's viewpoint. 
- Activities such as building Java projects, setup, and integration with Jenkins will be covered in detail.
- Maven is useful for developers as it helps in compiling code, downloading dependencies, building code, and packaging the code.

# What Is Maven

aven is a software project management and comprehension tool based on the concept of project object model (POM). It helps manage project build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.

- **Developer's Daily Activities**:
  - Write code in their favorite IDE.
  - Compile the code locally and test it.
  - Create a package and deploy it to a local application server for validation.
  - Push the working code to a source code repository or management system.

- **Challenge Faced by Developers**:
  - Need to manually download third-party libraries/packages required for compiling, testing, and packaging their code.
  - Difficulty in pushing all packages into the source code repository.

- **Solution Provided by Maven**:
  - Generates a single file called `pom.xml` that specifies required libraries/packages for an application.
  - Automatically downloads necessary dependencies during compilation/testing.
  - Simplifies the build, test, and deployment process with minimal effort.

- **Benefits of Using Maven**:
  - Efficiently builds applications with required packages.
  - Facilitates sharing only the source code along with the `pom.xml` file specifying dependencies.



# How Maven Helps a DevOps Engineer
- At the DevOps engineer level, Maven helps in building artifacts from the source code, managing dependencies, running unit tests, and deploying applications.
- Maven plays a crucial role in handling tasks such as downloading dependencies, building, unit testing, and deployment in the DevOps environment.

1. **Check-in Code to Source Code Management:** Developer needs to check-in the tested code into the source code management (e.g., Git).

2. **Build Artifacts:**  As a DevOps engineer, after checking in the code, build artifacts need to be created from the source code.

3. **Manage Dependencies:** Identify and manage all dependencies required for building the artifacts.

4. **Run Unit Test Cases:** After building artifacts, run unit test cases to ensure the functionality of the application.

5. **Deployment:** Once unit tests pass successfully, deploy the application using Maven.



# Create First Maven Project
To create an empty Maven project with no dependencies but with a POM file using the Command Line Interface (CLI), you can use the following command:
## Find Archetype
1. Run `mvn archetype:generate`. It will list all the maven archetypes. 
2. To filter archetypes containing "webapp": ```  mvn archetype:generate | grep webapp  ```

## Install Archetype
1. Open your command line interface (e.g., Command Prompt or Terminal).
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the Maven project.
3. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-empty-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-archetype -Dversion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
   ```
Here's what this command does:

- `mvn archetype:generate`: This command is used to generate a new Maven project from an archetype.
- `-DgroupId`: Specifies the Group ID for the project (e.g., `com.example`).
- `-DartifactId`: Specifies the Artifact ID for the project (e.g., `my-empty-project`).
- `-DarchetypeArtifactId`: Specifies the archetype to be used for generating the project. The `maven-archetype-archetype` archetype is used to create a basic structure with a POM file.
- `-DinteractiveMode=false`: Disables interactive mode and uses default values for any prompts during project generation.

This command will create a new Maven project in the specified directory with a basic POM file and no dependencies.
The `pom.xml` file will contain minimal configuration. You can then customize it further based on your project's needs.


# Maven Coordinates
Maven project creation involves providing Maven Coordinates such as Group Id, Artifact Id, Version, and Package. 
Maven Coordinates are essential for identifying and calling packages or applications in a project.

- Group Id: helps differentiate projects within an organization and is typically the company URL in reverse format.
- Artifact Id: is the name of the package and should be unique within a project.
- Version: indicates the release version of the project.
Packaging structure is usually represented as groupId:artifactId:version.
- Examples of Maven Coordinates used by organizations like Spring Boot were provided to understand how to specify groupId, artifactId, and version.

# Steps Involved in Building a Java Project
1. To build an application in Maven, the first step is to compile the source code (.java files) into .class files.
2. After compilation, test cases need to be run to ensure the code functions correctly.
3. Once test cases pass, a package such as a jar, ear, or war file is created.
4. The package can be deployed on the target system using Maven but it's not a real maven responsability

# Maven Goals
Maven Goals are essential for building Maven projects and are executed sequentially within a lifecycle.

### Important Commands:
- `clean`: Removes files generated by previous builds, delete the target folder.
- `validate`: Validates project correctness and necessary information availability.
- `compile`: Compiles the source code. Not the test code.
- `test-compile`: Tests the source code with written test cases.
- `test`: Tests the source code with written test cases.
- `package`: Packages compiled code into its distributed format (e.g., jar).
- `verify`: Checks to verify that the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
- `install`: Installs the package into the local repository (.m2 folder) for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
- `deploy`: Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other projects or developers.
- `site`: Used for documentation purposes but is not widely used.


# What Is Pom.xml and How It Works
**POM.xml (Project Object Model):** It is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. Contains project information and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. Default values, project description, artifact ID, version, configurations, etc., are specified in POM.xml.
- POM.xml is crucial for Maven projects as it defines project details and configurations.
- If packaging isn't specified the app will be packadge as a jar file
- Default values like groupId, artifactId, version ID are automatically generated in POM.xml when creating a project.
- Dependencies are specified in POM.xml to include required packages for building the project.
- Adding or removing dependencies affects the Maven Dependencies tab and impacts the project structure.
- Removing unnecessary dependencies helps keep the project clean and efficient.
- Every depedency in the pom file will be downloaded and present in the maven dependencies + transitive dependencies.

**Transitive Dependency**  additional dependency that is brought in by a primary dependency.   - These dependencies are necessary for the primary dependency to function properly. 



## Strcture
- `<project>`: The root element of the `pom.xml` file.
- `<modelVersion>` : Specifies the model version, which is always `4.0.0` for Maven 2 and later.
- `<groupId>`: Defines the group or organization that the project belongs to. This is often a reversed domain name, like `com.example`.
- `<artifactId>`: A unique identifier for the project within the group. Usually, it is the name of the project.
- `<version>`: Specifies the version of the project. Common formats include `1.0`, `1.0.0`, `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.
- `<packaging>`: Specifies the packaging type of the project, such as `jar`, `war`, `pom`, etc. The default is `jar`.
- `<dependencies>`: A list of dependencies for the project. Each dependency is specified within a `<dependency>` element.
- `<build>`: ontains elements used to configure the build process, including plugins, directories, and resources.

```xml
<build>
    <sourceDirectory>src/main/java</sourceDirectory>
    <resources>
        <resource>
            <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
        </resource>
    </resources>
    <plugins>
        <!-- Plugins go here -->
    </plugins>
</build>
```
- `<sourceDirectory>`: Specifies the directory containing the source code.
- `<resources>`: Defines the resources to be included in the build, such as configuration files.
- `<plugins>`: Specifies plugins used in the build process. Each plugin is defined within a `<plugin>` element.
- `<plugin>`: Defines a plugin used in the build process.
- `<repositories>`: Specifies additional repositories where Maven should look for dependencies and plugins.
- `<properties>`: Defines project-specific properties that can be referenced within the `pom.xml`.
- `<profiles>`: Defines different build configurations, which can be activated based on various criteria like environment variables or system properties.

```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>dev</id>
        <properties>
            <env>development</env>
        </properties>
    </profile>
    <!-- Additional profiles -->
</profiles>
```

# Maven Repositories
**Local Repository:** is created under the user's home directory (.m2). It stores required packages from the internet for future use.
**Maven Central Repository (remote):** is used to pull required packages.  
**Enterprise Repository:** A layer between the Remote and Local repository. Can be used internally by companies for adding security.
- Maven goals help in managing packages in Local or Enterprise Repositories.



# Set Up Maven
On Linux:
1. Install java and Maven
2. Set up the home path for Maven by updating the  `M2_HOME`  and `M2` (point to the bin) environment variables.
4. Add the Maven path to the system path by modifying the `$PATH` variable.
5. Validate the Maven setup by running the command `mvn --version`.


# Build Maven Project on Linux
1. Check if Git is installed:    ```  git   ```
2. Install Git:    ```   yum install git / sudo apt install git   ```
3. Clone a repository:    ```   git clone <repository_name>   ```
4. Compile code:    ```   mvn compile   ```
5. Test source code:    ```   mvn test   ```
6. Package the code:    ```   mvn package   ```
7. Install project locally:     ```    mvn install    ``` or `mvn clean install` for best practice


# Settings.xml File
You can define various settings such as repository URLs, plugin configurations, proxy settings, server credentials, etc. in the `SETTINGS.xml` file.
- **Settings.xml in Maven**: Contains elements to define values for configuring Maven execution.
- **Purpose**: Global configuration for common values across environments.
- **Locations**:
  - Maven installation directory (e.g., `${MAVEN_HOME}/conf/settings.xml`). For global settings
  - User-specific `${USER_HOME}/.m2` directory for creating settings.xml. For user specific settings


# Deploying a Java Web Application on Tomcat Server

## 1. **Security Considerations**
Ensure that your credentials and the Tomcat Manager interface are secured, especially in a production environment. Use environment variables for sensitive information and restrict access to the Manager interface.

## 2. **Setting Up Tomcat on EC2**

### 2.1. **Install and Start Tomcat**
1. Install Tomcat on your EC2 instance.
2. Ensure that port 8080 is open in your security group settings to allow access to the Tomcat Manager.
3. Start Tomcat using:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start tomcat9
   ```
   or:
   ```sh
   ./startup.sh
   ```

### 2.2. **Configure Tomcat Manager**
To allow Maven to deploy applications to your Tomcat server, you need to configure the Tomcat Manager.

1. **Edit the `tomcat-users.xml` File**:
   - This file is located in the `conf` directory of your Tomcat installation (e.g., `/usr/share/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml`).
   - Add a user with the `manager-script` role:
   ```xml
   <tomcat-users>
       <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
       <role rolename="manager-script"/>
       <user username="your-username" password="your-password" roles="manager-gui,manager-script"/>
   </tomcat-users>
   ```

2. **Restart Tomcat**:
   - Apply the changes by restarting Tomcat:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart tomcat9
   ```

## 3. **Configuring Maven for Deployment**

### 3.1. **Update Maven `settings.xml`**

1. On your local machine, locate or create the Maven `settings.xml` file, typically located in `~/.m2/settings.xml`. If it doesn’t exist, you can copy it from `${MAVEN_HOME}/conf/settings.xml`.
   
2. Add your Tomcat server credentials to the `settings.xml` file:
   ```xml
   <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                                 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
       <servers>
           <server>
               <id>TomcatServer</id>
               <username>your-username</username>
               <password>your-password</password>
           </server>
       </servers>
   </settings>
   ```

### 3.2. **Configure `pom.xml`**

1. Add the `tomcat7-maven-plugin` to your Maven `pom.xml` file:
   ```xml
   <project>
       <!-- Other configurations -->
       <build>
           <plugins>
               <plugin>
                   <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
                   <artifactId>tomcat7-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                   <version>2.2</version>
                   <configuration>
                       <url>http://your-ec2-public-dns:8080/manager/text</url>
                       <server>TomcatServer</server>
                       <path>/your-app-context-path</path>
                   </configuration>
               </plugin>
           </plugins>
       </build>
   </project>
   ```

## 4. **Deploying Your Application**

### 4.1. **Deploy**
Use the following Maven command to deploy your application:
```sh
mvn clean install tomcat7:deploy
```

### 4.2. **Redeploy**
If the application is already deployed and you need to update it, use:
```sh
mvn tomcat7:redeploy
```

### 4.3. **Undeploy**
To remove the application from the server, use:
```sh
mvn tomcat7:undeploy
```
