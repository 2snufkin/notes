# Content Overview
In this lecture, we'll cover:


1. **Git Fundamentals:**

   - Setting up Git on Windows and Linux using Git Bash.
   - Working with repositories and stages of Git.
   - Using GitHub for collaboration, including creating accounts, repositories, and pushing changes.
   - Understanding Git Commits, branches, and their role in DevOps workflows.
   - Resolving merge conflicts and reverting changes.

2. **Collaboration and Projects:**
   - Working with teams, including Git Forks, Pull Requests, and managing repositories.
   - Real-world application through project setup, development, and release processes.


This summary focuses on the essentials of Git and GitHub covered in the lecture.

# What Is Version Control System and Why Git
**Git:** Highly popular due to its distributed nature, flexibility, and robust branching model.
**Other VCS:** Includes tools like Bitbucket, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce, and GitLab, each with its own strengths and use cases.

## Why Version Control Systems?
When multiple developers collaborate on a project, coordinating code changes manually becomes cumbersome and error-prone. Version Control Systems streamline this process by:
+ Tracking Changes: Every modification made to the codebase is recorded, facilitating easier troubleshooting and rollback.
+ Collaborative Development: Enables seamless collaboration by allowing developers to work on different parts of the project concurrently.
+ Change History: Provides a log of who made what changes and when, aiding in accountability and project management.
+ Reverting Changes: Offers the ability to revert back to previous versions of the code if needed.

## Types of Version Control Systems
**Local VCS:** Operates on a developer's local machine.
Suitable for individual developers or small projects but lacks collaboration features.

**Centralized VCS:** Relies on a central server that stores the master copy of the project. 
Enables collaboration but requires constant server access for developers to work effectively.

**Distributed VCS (Git):** Most widely used.
Each developer maintains a local repository that mirrors the central repository.
Facilitates offline work and allows developers to synchronize changes independently.


# Set Up an EC2 Instance and Install Git
EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. It is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual computers on which they can run their own applications. EC2 
## Steps

1. **Create an AWS Account**
   - If you don't have an AWS account, please refer to the videos at the end of this Git course on how to create one and launch a Linux EC2 instance.

2. **Launch a Linux EC2 Instance**
   - **AWS Management Console**: Go to your AWS Management Console.
   - **Choose Region**: Select a region.
   - **EC2 Dashboard**: Go to `All Services` -> `EC2`.
   - **Launch Instance**: Click on `Launch instance`.
   - **Choose AMI**: Select `Amazon Linux`.
   - **Instance Type**: Choose `t2.micro` for free usage.
   - **Configure Instance Details**: No changes needed.
   - **Add Storage**: No changes needed.
   - **Add Tags**: Name your instance (e.g., Developer2_System).
   - **Configure Security Group**: Create a new security group (e.g., Git_SG) with port 22 open for SSH.
   - **Review and Launch**: Review settings and launch the instance.
   - **Key Pair**: Create and download a key pair. You should give it a name and click on the Download button. It will download a .pem file.\n
   With this key you can connect to your instance from other comuters using the terminal. 
   - **IPv4**: After creating the instance click on it to see the details. Write the IPV4 public IP if you want to connect it distnacely.

3. **Connect to the EC2 Instance**
   - **MobaXterm**: Download and install MobaXterm.
   - **SSH Connection**:
     - Open MobaXterm.
     - Go to `Session` -> `SSH`.
     - Enter the public IP address of your instance.
     - Go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Use private key` and select your downloaded key pair (git_key).
     - Set the username to `ec2-user` and connect.

4. **Install Git**
   - **Become Root User**: 
     - Execute `sudo su -` to switch to the root user.
   - **Install Git**:
     - Run `yum install git -y` to install Git.
   - **Verify Installation**:
     - Run `git --version` to check the installed Git version.
