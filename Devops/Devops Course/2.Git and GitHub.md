# What Is Version Control System and Why Git
**Git:** Highly popular due to its distributed nature, flexibility, and robust branching model.
**Other VCS:** Includes tools like Bitbucket, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce, and GitLab, each with its own strengths and use cases.

## Why Version Control Systems?
When multiple developers collaborate on a project, coordinating code changes manually becomes cumbersome and error-prone. Version Control Systems streamline this process by:
+ Tracking Changes: Every modification made to the codebase is recorded, facilitating easier troubleshooting and rollback.
+ Collaborative Development: Enables seamless collaboration by allowing developers to work on different parts of the project concurrently.
+ Change History: Provides a log of who made what changes and when, aiding in accountability and project management.
+ Reverting Changes: Offers the ability to revert back to previous versions of the code if needed.

## Types of Version Control Systems
**Local VCS:** Operates on a developer's local machine.
Suitable for individual developers or small projects but lacks collaboration features.

**Centralized VCS:** Relies on a central server that stores the master copy of the project. 
Enables collaboration but requires constant server access for developers to work effectively.

**Distributed VCS (Git):** Most widely used.
Each developer maintains a local repository that mirrors the central repository.
Facilitates offline work and allows developers to synchronize changes independently.

# Working with Git Bash
If you've never configured your Git account on this computer, run the following commands. This will prevent your commits from being anonymous. You only need to configure this once.


## Introduce yourself to Git

```cmd
git config --global user.name {username}
git config --global user.email {email}
```

- `git config --global user.name {username}`: Sets the global Git username configuration. Replace `{username}` with your desired username. This is used to identify you as the author of commits.

- `git config --global user.email {email}`: Sets the global Git email configuration. Replace `{email}` with your email address associated with your Git account. This is used to associate your commits with your Git account.

## Check current configuration

```cmd
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```
- `git config --global user.name`: Retrieves and displays the currently configured global Git username.
- `git config --global user.email`: Retrieves and displays the currently configured global Git email address.





# Connecting to GitHub Using SSH
Connecting to GitHub using SSH ensures secure communication between your local machine and GitHub. Follow these simple steps:

1. **Generate SSH Key**: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`     - Follow the prompts to save the key.
`-t ed25519`: Specifies the type of key to create. ed25519 is a newer type of key that is considered to be more secure and efficient compared to the default RSA keys.
`-C "your_email@example.com"`: Adds a comment to the key. This is usually your email address and is helpful for identifying the key later on.


2. **Add SSH Key to SSH-Agent**:
- Start the SSH agent and set up your environment to use it `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- Add your SSH private key to the agent `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- Stoping in this step and trying to cloning using SSH will return a premmision errors since we didn't connect the ssh key to github
3. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
    - Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
```bash
      cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
 ```
- Go to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys), click "New SSH key," and paste your key.

4. **Test the Connection**: `ssh -T git@github.com` You should see a success message.


# Creating a Repository on Git

**Before working with Git**: 
   - All Git commands start with `git`. This includes configuration commands like `git config --global`.
   - Properly configuring Git (user name, email) ensures correct attribution of commits.
   - Git revolves around repositories. Repositories are essential for tracking changes.
   - Most Git commands should be run inside a Git repository, indicated by the presence of a `.git` directory.

**Creating a Git Repository**:  `git init .` A .git folder will be created. This is a marker that the folder is a git repo.
**Managing Files in a Git Repository**: Files and directories created within a Git repository are automatically **tracked** by Git.


# Git Workflow

## Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository


**Working Directory:** The working directory is where you modify files for your project, where you ran the commend `git init .`.
`git add <file>`:  From Working Directory to Staging Area, to stage files for the next commit.
**Staging Area (Index):** Files in the working directory are staged using `git add` to prepare them for a commit.
`git commit -m "Commit message"`: From Staging Area to Repository to commit staged changes to the repository.
`git checkout -- <file>`: Moving Back to Working Directory to discard changes in the working directory (unstaged changes). This command is used to discard changes in the working directory for a specific file. It reverts the file to the state it was in at the last commit or last time git add was used on it.
`git reset HEAD <file>` This command is used to unstage files from the staging area, it does not discard changes but moves files from the staging area back to the working directory, effectively "unstaging" them.
**Repository:** The repository (`.git` directory) stores committed changes and their history.
`git log`: See the commits history

### Viewing Changes History and Logs
- `git status`: Where are the files are located in this moment. Workin area, staging area, or commited to repo?
red: working area. untracked files that are in the 
green: stagin area. Changes to be commited
- `git log` to view commit history.
- `git diff` shows changes between commits, while `git diff --staged` shows staged changes.


# Compare Code Changes 
## Between Different Git Stages
To compare changes between the:
- working directory and staging area, use the `git diff` command.
- staging area and local repository, use `git diff --staged`. This command is often used when you want to review what changes you have staged before committing them.
- working directory files with the local repository, use `git diff HEAD`.
- Additional options include `git diff --staged HEAD` for comparing staging area with the local repository.


## Between Local Commits
+ Use `git diff <commitID> <commitID>` to compare specific commits. Comparing commits helps track changes and understand the history of code modifications.
+ Use `git diff HEAD HEAD~<x>`. the ~ refers to the commit x steps back from HEAD.
When you compare two commits the colors typically used in the diff view represent different types of changes:
**Green**: lines that have been added compared to the previous commit or version.
**Red**:lines that have been deleted compared to the previous commit or version.
**White (or no color)**: unchanged between the two commits being compared. These lines remain the same in content.

# Cloning a Repo from GitHub
1. Copy the HTTPS URL of the remote repository from GitHub.
2. Open Git Bash in the desired working directory on your local system.
3. Clone the remote repository using `git clone <repository_URL>` command.
4. Verify that a new folder with `.git` directory has been created, indicating successful cloning.

# Push Code onto Remote Repository
Pushing code to GitHub repository ensures that the latest updates are available for all developers.
- Use `git push origin master` command to push changes from the local repository to the remote (GitHub) repository.
- Check for commits in both local and remote repositories using `git log` and compare them to ensure synchronization of code.



# Git Clone Versus Git Pull
The difference between git clone and git pull:
**git clone:**  clone a repository from GitHub for the first time when the repository does not exist in the local system
**git pull:**  used when the repository is already present in the local system but you want to check if your local repository is up to date with the remote repository.
- When executing git pull, it fetches changes from the remote repository and updates your local copy accordingly. Any new commits or modifications made in the remote repository will be reflected in your local workspace after using git pull.

# Unable to Push Changes onto Remote Repository
Avoid force-pushing (`git push -f`) unless you understand the implications, as it can overwrite changes on the remote repository.

When attempting to push changes to a remote Git repository, you may encounter an error if the remote repository contains commits that you do not have locally. This situation typically arises when:
1. **Outdated Local Repository:** Your local repository is not up-to-date with the latest changes from the remote repository.
2. **Conflicting Changes:** There are conflicting changes between your local repository and the remote repository, and Git cannot automatically resolve these conflicts.
3.**Branch Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to push changes to the remote branch.

## Solutions:
1. Pull Changes from Remote Repository: `git pull origin <branch-name>`
2. Resolve Conflicts (if any):
3. Push Changes to Remote Repository:



# Map Local Repo with Remote Repository - Git Remote Add
To connect a local Git repository with a remote repository, use the `git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>` command.
- `<remote-name>` is a name you choose to represent the remote repository (e.g., origin).
- `<remote-url>` is the URL of the remote repository where you want to push your changes.
- After adding a remote, you can use commands like `git push` and `git pull` to interact with the remote repository.
- Verify the added remotes using `git remote -v`.

## Create remote repo via the terminal
1. Navigate to the folder where the code lies
2. `gh repo create <repository-name> --public --source=. --remote=origin`
The commend can take more flags:
```base
gh repo create my-repo --public --source=. --remote=origin --description="My new repository" --homepage="https://example.com" --enable-issues --disable-wiki --gitignore=Node --license=mit
```
Breakdown of the Example Command
my-repo: The name of the new repository.
- public: Creates the repository as public.
- source=.: Uses the current directory as the source.
- remote=origin: Names the new remote as origin.
- description="My new repository": Adds a description.
- homepage="https://example.com": Sets a homepage URL.
- enable-issues: Enables GitHub Issues.
- disable-wiki: Disables the GitHub Wiki.
- gitignore=Node: Adds a .gitignore file based on the Node template.
- license=mit: Adds an MIT license to the repository.



# Working with Commits on Git
- Commits can be referenced by commit's id or by its distance from HEAD
- `HEAD` always represents the content available in our repository, pointing to the latest commit.
- We can compare the latest commit with the previous commit using `git diff` command.
- The red color in `git diff` output represents changes in the latest commit, while green shows lines from the previous commit not present in the latest one.
- To compare different commits, we can use `git diff HEAD HEAD~1` or specify other commit references like `HEAD~2`, `HEAD~3`, etc.
- to move to a previous commit and see the code in this particular point in time (time travel) use `git checkout <commit hash>`. When you checkout a commit directly, you enter a detached HEAD state, meaning that you are no longer on a branch, and any changes made are not associated with any branch unless you create one.
- to exit the detached Head and to switch back to the previous branch you were on `git switch -` 
# Know Information about Specific Commit on Git
- Executing `git show <commit_SHA>` shows the changes introduced in that commit.
- Use `git log` to find the commit SHA code.
- `HEAD` represents the latest commit, while `origin/master` refers to the remote repository.
- Use `HEAD-2` or `HEAD~2` to view changes in previous commits.
- To check who made changes in a specific file, use `git annotate <file_name>`.


# Working with Commits and Files on GitHub
## Commits
1. Click on the commits buttons. Another page wil lbe open with a list of one or more commits. each commit has 3 buttons:
id: if you click you see all the files that were changed in the commit
copy button: will copy to the clipboard the id of the commit (full SHA)
<>: let you browse the repo at this point in time, how the code base was after commiting this commit. It's the same as `git checkout <commit>`

## File 
if you click on one of the file you have sever button ofn top:
code: it's the default view
blame: for each line it shows: who modify the line, when, the commit comment, and how it was prior to the modification (there is an icon for that)


# Why Do We Need Branches on Git
- Default branch in a repository is called Master. It is not mandatory to maintain the master branch.
- Advantages of using branches include efficient code management, testing, and deployment.
- Creating separate branches for development helps in isolating working code from potentially problematic code.
- Branches allow for controlled deployment of tested and verified code to production systems.

# Branches in DevOps Workflow
- **Feature Branches:**  Created for developing new features or fixing bugs.  Once the feature is complete, it is merged back into the test branch.
- **Test Branche:** Used for ongoing development work. Feature branches are merged into this branch for integration testing. then it's deployed on the test server.
- **QA Branch**: When the testing team approved, it merge to the QA branch and should be deployed to the QA server
- **Prod Branch:** Main branch where the production-ready code resides. Changes are typically merged into this branch after thorough testing.

- Branching is a common practice in DevOps workflows to manage different versions of code and isolate changes.
- Feature branches are created for each new feature or bug fix, allowing developers to work on changes without affecting the main branch.
- Release branches can be created to prepare for a new software release, allowing for stabilization and last-minute fixes before deployment.
- Branching strategy with Development, Test, Quality, and Production branches.
- Use Test branch for initial code deployment and testing on Test system.
- Fix bugs and enhance code based on Test system feedback.
- Move working code to Quality and Production branches for further deployment.
- Version control for different stages of code development (e.g., version1, version2).
- Continuously enhance code and release new versions for QA and Production systems.

# Working with Branches on GitHub
Branches act as snapshots of your code, allowing you to experiment and make changes independently. Changes made in the new branch do not impact the main branch until they are merged.

**Creating a New Branch**: Use the command `git checkout -b <branch_name>` to create a new branch from the current branch.  
**Create and Switch to a New Branch:**`git switch -c new-branch-name`.  
**Switching Between Branches**: Use `git switch <branch_name>` to switch between branches and work on different features or fixes.  
**Merge Branches**: Once changes in a branch are tested and validated, you can merge them back into the main branch using pull requests or merging strategies.
changes from feature branches back into the main codebase.


# Merge Changes onto Master Branch
1. Ensure you are on the destination branch (where you want to commit your changes) before using `git merge`.
2. Use the `git merge` command to merge changes from one branch to another.
3. Example: `git checkout master`, then `git merge test` to merge changes from the test branch to the master branch.
4. After merging, check the status using `git log` and `git status`.

# Resolving Merge Conflicts
- Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes from two branches.
- To resolve a merge conflict, identify the conflicting files and open them in an editor.
- Manually edit the conflicting lines to resolve the differences between the branches.
- After resolving conflicts, stage the changes and commit them to complete the merge process.
- Use `git status` to check for any remaining conflicts or unmerged changes.
- It's important to communicate with team members when resolving conflicts to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

# Forking a Repository
- Forking a repository allows you to copy a repository from another account to your own account on GitHub. It doesn't copy it to your local machine, this is cloning.
- After forking, you can clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone` command.

- Forking creates an independent copy of the repository on your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original repository.
- You can Fork a repository directly on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button on the repository's page.
- Make changes, commit them, and push them to your forked repository.
- You can create a pull request from your forked repository to contribute changes back to the original project.
- Remember to keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository by adding it as a remote and pulling changes before making new contributions.
- Once Forked, you can make modifications to the code in your Forked repository and push those changes back to the original repository through a Pull Request.
- Pull Requests play a crucial role in sharing and merging code changes between different repositories.
- Remember to keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository by adding it as a remote and pulling changes before making new contributions.


# Creating Pull Request (PR)
- Creating a Pull request enables collaboration between different GitHub accounts for code review and merging.
- Merge will happen between 2 diffrent branches on your own repository, on your own account
- PR will happen when you try to merge your code from your github account to a code that is on a diffrent github account.


# Adding Collaborator to a Repository
- The process involves inviting a user as a collaborator, which allows them to make changes directly to the repository without needing approval for each commit.
- Collaborators can push their changes directly to the repository owner's account, and the changes will be merged without creating a pull request.
- The owner of the repository can manage access and invite collaborators through the Settings menu on GitHub.
- Collaborators need to clone the repository before they can accept an invitation to collaborate.
- Once added as a collaborator, users can work together on the project and make changes seamlessly.

# Creating Protected Branches
- Setting -> Branches -> Add branch ruleset / Add classic branch protectio rule

# Tagging a Commit
- Tags are:
1. used to mark specific points in the history of a project, making it easier to reference and remember important commits.
2.  Creating tags helps in identifying and marking significant versions or releases of a project.
3. similar to branches but do not change with new commits.
4. useful for reverting back to specific points in history, especially when working on different versions or releases of a project.
5. Use tags as reference points to switch between different versions of code easily.
6. Tags help maintain clarity and organization in Git repositories by marking important milestones and versions of the project.

## Creating a tag
- `git tag`: This command is used to list all existing tags in the repository.
- `git tag <tag_name>`: Creates a new lightweight tag at the current commit.
- `git tag -a <tag_name> -m "tag message"`: Creates an annotated tag with a message describing the tag.
- `git show <tag_name>`: Displays information about a specific tag.
- `git push origin <tag_name>`: Pushes a specific tag to the remote repository.
- `git push --tags`: Pushes all local tags to the remote repository.


# Revert Changes 
Certainly! Here's a revised version of the Markdown file with corrected and clarified information on reverting changes in Git:

---

# Reverting Changes in Git
Reverting changes in Git can be done when the file is in the: working directory, staging area, and local repository.

## Revert Changes from Working Directory

To discard changes in the working directory and revert to the last committed state:

- Use `git restore <file_name>` or `git checkout -- <file_name>`.

## Revert Changes from Staging Area

To unstage changes from the staging area and return them to the working directory:

1. Use `git restore --staged <file_name>` 
2. Then, use `git restore <file_name>` to discard changes from the working directory.

## Revert Changes from Local Repository
- Remember to discard changes from the working directory after reverting commits.
- For newly created files, manually delete them as `git restore` won't affect them.
- To discard changes from the local repository and revert to the last committed state:
1. Use `git reset HEAD <file_name>` to unstage changes, keeping them in the working directory.
2. Then, use `git restore <file_name>` to discard changes from the working directory.

## Reverting Commits in Local Repository
To revert commits in the local repository and move `HEAD` to a previous commit:
- Use `git reset HEAD^1` to reset `HEAD` to the parent of the current commit.
- After resetting, use `git checkout -- <file_name>` to discard changes from the working directory.

## Git Reset Command
The `git reset` command adjusts `HEAD` to the specified commit:

- `git reset --soft <commit>`: Keeps changes in the working directory and staging area. Useful when you want to undo a commit but keep your changes staged.
- `git reset --mixed <commit>`: default behavior if no option is specified. Resets the staging area to match the specified commit, keeping changes in the working directory.
- `git reset --hard <commit>`: Resets both the staging area and the working directory to match the specified commit, discarding all changes.

Use `git reset` with caution, especially `--hard`, as it can irreversibly delete uncommitted changes.
