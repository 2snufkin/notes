# DevOps Introduction
**Tutor:** A.R. Shankar By Valaxy Technologies valaxyteach@gmail.com

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The aim is to enhance the software development lifecycle through continuous delivery with high quality.

**Roles of DevOps Engineer:** DevOps engineers manage the deployment of code from developers onto servers, ensuring adherence to development rules and conditions set by developers.

## Technology Stack Covered:
Git (Version Control), Jenkins (CI), Maven (Build), SonarQube (Code Analysis), JFrog Artifactory (Artifact Repository), Docker (Containerization), Ansible (Deployment & Configuration Management), Kubernetes (Container Orchestration), Prometheus (Monitoring), and Grafana (Alerting).

# Devops Tools 
1. Developer give the  code to the devops and te devops engineer copy the code to the server
2. The devops need to compile and deploy it on test and prod servers
3. The prod should be up, running all the time

### Source Code Management: Git
Manage and maintain source code versions.

### Compilation: Maven
- **Purpose:** Compiles source code into executable artifacts.

### Integration: Jenkins
- **Purpose:** Automates integration of various stages of the development pipeline.

### Deployment: Ansible
- **Purpose:** Automates deployment of applications onto servers.

### Infrastructure:  AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
Provides the necessary infrastructure (servers, containers) for deploying applications.

### Monitoring: Prometheus
Monitors and ensures the uptime and performance of applications and servers.

**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC**):** The SDLC involves stages from client requirements to production deployment, including continuous development, integration, deployment, testing, and monitoring.

# Create AWS Acoount
**Summary:**
In this lecture, we will learn how to create an AWS Free Tier Account, which is essential for setting up a Linux server and useful for using AWS or DevOps services in the future.

1. **Google Search:**
   - Open Google and search for "AWS Free Tier account."
   - Click on the first result to go to the AWS Free Tier page.

2. **Create Account:**
   - Click on "Create a Free Account."
   - Provide your email, password, and AWS account name.

3. **Account Type:**
   - Choose between a Professional or Personal account. 
   - Fill in your personal information and continue.

4. **Payment Information:**
   - Provide your credit or debit card details and PAN card if necessary.
   - AWS will deduct a small amount for verification.
   - Enter the OTP to verify your payment information.

5. **Identity Verification:**
   - Provide your phone number for validation via SMS or voice call.
   - Enter the received verification code to continue.

6. **Support Plan:**
   - Choose a support plan: Basic (no technical support), Development, or Business (faster technical support).
   - For learning purposes, select the Free Tier account.

7. **Sign In:**
   - Log into the AWS Management Console using your root user email and password.
   - Navigate to "All services" and select "EC2" under Compute for Linux practice.

8. **Account Activation:**
   - Verify your email address to fully activate your account.
   - Check your email for verification messages from AWS.
   - Click on the link in the email to access your account.

9. **Access EC2 Services:**
   - Once verified, you can access EC2 services and create EC2 instances.
