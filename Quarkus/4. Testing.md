# Testing Endpoints with REST Assured

when Quarkus executes your tests, it will automatically deploy a database for you.

In general, writing a Quarkus unit test is much like writing a regular JUnit 5 unit test.  However, there are some nuances that we must be aware of:
+ When you run a Quarkus test, Quarkus starts your application in the background. This makes it ideal to implement tests that integrate several layers of your application. 
+ Mocking is still possible via dependency injection, but you need to declare these mocked beans using Quarkus-specific instructions.

## JUnit

JUnit is one of the most popular and widespread unit testing frameworks for Java. Developers use this framework to implement and execute automated tests for their Java applications. Its tight integration with almost all IDEs and build tools makes it a perfect candidate for this purpose, and most organizations have adopted it as their main testing framework.


## REST Assured DSL
REST Assured is a library to test and validate REST services in Java. Its support for easily building HTTP requests and its tight integration with Quarkus makes it a great tool to implement integration tests.

provides methods that help you organize your tests following the common Given-When-Then or Arrange-Act-Assert testing structure. Methods like when(), then(), body() etc..

REST Assured allows you to perform [JSONPath queries](https://support.smartbear.com/alertsite/docs/monitors/api/endpoint/jsonpath.html) to the response body and validate them with expression matchers


## Test security JWT
Test security JWT: Dependency provided by Quarkus to test applications that are implemented with a JWT security layer. It has a transitive dependency on the quarkus-test-security artifact, which provides the common test framework used for all of the Quarkus security providers.\

### Adding to the project
Though most of the required test dependencies were added when we bootstrapped the project, we’ll need an additional dependency to be able to test our secured application. The quarkus-test-security-jwt

`./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=io.quarkus:quarkus-test-security-jwt`
go to rhe pom.xml file, find this dependency and add the scope
 `<scope>test</scope>` 


## Strategy
We have implemented:
1. the persistence layer for the application with Entites. 
2. the business and presentation layers: HTTP API
3. Security Layer.

We could implement unit tests to verify the application functionality for each layer individually. However, this approach would require mocking each layer’s dependencies and would require a complex test implementation, which would also mean that its maintenance would be expensive. 

If the business logic is not too complex, we’ll treat each of the individual application features as a test unit and implement an integration test for each functionality covering the three layers. 

## Configuring the application
Whenever we execute a Quarkus test, Quarkus will spin up a real application instance to perform the verifications. Considering this, it’s interesting to prepare the test environment and add some initial data to the database. For this purpose, we need to edit the application.properties file and add the following entry:

`%test.quarkus.hibernate-orm.sql-load-script=import-dev.sql`

In the Configuring Quarkus section in Chapter 2, Adding Persistence, we configured the same property but for the dev profile instead. As we learned, this property defines a path to a file containing SQL statements that will be executed when the application starts. For the testing environment, these statements will be executed when the application starts and before the tests are run. 

## Creating a test class
IntelliJ can create the test suite class for us.
1. Go to the AuthResource, right click on the class declaration => Go To => Test
2. On the pop up menu click => create new test and then OK

## Writing a test

```
@QuarkusTest
class AuthResourceTest {
  @Test
  void loginValidCredentials() {
    given()
      .body("{\"name\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"quarkus\"}")
      .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
      .when().post("/api/v1/auth/login")
      .then()
      .statusCode(200)
      .body(not(emptyString()));
  }
  //Verify that a user with wrong password isn't able to authenticate and retrieve a JWT (providing wrong password=> not-quarkus)
  
  @Test
  void loginInvalidCredentials() {
    given()
      .body("{\"name\":\"admin\",\"password\":\
        "not-quarkus\"}")
      .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
      .when().post("/api/v1/auth/login")
      .then()
      .statusCode(401);
  }
}
```

@QuarkusTest: configures Quarkus to run the application in test mode so that we can then perform real HTTP requests to verify the application’s behavior.\
@Test: Junit5 standard annotation that instructs JUnit to execute this method as a test case.\
given(): REST Assured domain-specific language (DSL) method to build the HTTP request.\
1. Preparing the HTTP request:
body: for the request with a JSON string, containing valid credentials using the REST Assured body() method. 
Content-Type HTTP header: in this case, application/json.
2. Preforming the HTTP verb with REST Assured DSL methods: 
when() follow by the desired HTTP method post()  pointing to the endpoint.
3. Preform assertion for the response:
REST Assured provides DSL methods to perform assertions for the response of the executed HTTP request too. Call the then() method and then verifyi what you want to verify. example:  that the response has a 200 OK successful status code and contains a non-empty body.


## Running a test
### With IntelliJ
To run the test suite in IntelliJ, we need to click on the play button near the class definition and click on the Run ‘AuthResourceTest’ menu 

### With Maven
`./mvnw clean test`: run all tests

Or if you just want to , run the following:

`./mvnw clean test -Dtest=<TestClassName>`: test the current test suite

# Testing Services

## Disabling authorization

This test verifies that a user with an administrative role can retrieve a list of all the users. To access this endpoint we need a Token.

To test the user endpoints, we could retrieve a valid JWT and include it as an HTTP request header.\
However, Quarkus provides a very handy **@TestSecurity** annotation to control the application’s security context when the test is run.\
The @TestSecurity: completely disable authorization so that secured endpoints can be accessed without being authenticated or to specify the identity and roles of the application’s context user for requests performed during the annotated test execution.


## Testing GET

```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "admin")
void list() {
  given()
  // HTTP GET request to /api/v1/users endpoint
    .when().get("/api/v1/users")
    .then()
    // verifying a 200 STATUS code
    .statusCode(200)
    // verify the JSON response: that we have at least one user
    .body("$.size()", greaterThanOrEqualTo(1),
    // with the name of admin
      "[0].name", is("admin"),
      // and that we don't include/leaking the password in the response
      "[0].password", nullValue());
}
```

These tests verify that only users with the admin role can create new users and assign them roles. The following snippet contains the source code for a test that verifies the happy path for the user creation procedure:

## CREATE: Testing POST endpoint, the Happy Path
Happy path: in the context of testing, is the scenario that showcases a feature’s workflow when no exception occurs and the action completes successfully.

```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "admin")
void create() {
  given()
  // Mise En Place, building the HTTP request
  //The body contains the minimum required fields to create a valid user
    .body("{\"name\":\"test\",\"password\":\"test\",
      \"roles\":[\"user\"]}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    // The HTTP request is sent with a POST method
    .when().post("/api/v1/users")
    .then()
    // Assertion phase
    // Validate that the HTTP response returns a 201 Created successful status code
    .statusCode(201)
    // Verify that the response contains a JSON body with the new user’s information
    .body(
      "name", is("test"),
      "password", nullValue(),
      "created", not(emptyString())
    );
}
```

## CREATE: Testing POST endpoint, the !Happy Path
In the happy path scenario, we have verified that a user with the admin role can create a user. Let us now test that a regular user can’t invoke the endpoint. 

```
@Test
// The context is of a simple user and not an admin
@TestSecurity(user = "user", roles = "user")
void createUnauthorized() {
  given()
    .body("{\"name\":\"test-unauthorized\",\"password\"
      :\"test\",\"roles\":[\"user\"]}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .when().post("/api/v1/users")
    .then()
    // Assert that  the HTTP response contains a 403 Forbidden client error status code
    .statusCode(403);
}
```

### Testing Constraint
The User entity has a unique constraint for the name field, you should create a scenario to verify that the constraint is enforced. 
```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "admin")
void createDuplicate() {
  given()
  // creating a user with the same name of a user that exist in the DB
    .body("{\"name\":\"user\",\"password\":
      \"test\",\"roles\":[\"user\"]}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .when().post("/api/v1/users")
    .then()
    // assert that the response has a 409 Conflict client error status code
    .statusCode(409);
}
```

If the DB change and the user is deleted, or modified the test will suddenly fail because we lost the duplicated user. This is why is better to work with a data that come from a  .sql file.
 
## UPDATE
This one is a bit different from what we saw till now. It contains two REST Assured invocations (given):
1. to prepare the test scenario 
2. to perform the actual test and its assertions.
```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "admin")
void update() {
// 1. Preparing: creating a new user
  var user = given()
    .body("{\"name\":\"to-update\",\"password\":
      \"test\",\"roles\":[\"user\"]}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .when().post("/api/v1/users")
    // instead of providing a then() DSL method assertion, the HTTP response body is deserialized into a User instance.
    .as(User.class);
    // updating the name
  user.name = "updated";
  // 2. The Test
  given()
    .body(user)
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .when().put("/api/v1/users/" + user.id)
    .then()
    .statusCode(200)
    // assert that the response body contains the updated user information with an incremented value in the version field
    .body(
      "name", is("updated"),
      "version", is(user.version + 1)
    );
}
```


### Example 2
```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "user", roles = "user")
void setComplete() {
// creating a task
  var toSetComplete = given()
    .body("{\"title\":\"to-set-complete\"}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .post("/api/v1/tasks").as(Task.class);
  given()
    .body("\"true\"")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    // modifing it (as complete)
    .when().put("/api/v1/tasks/" + toSetComplete.id + "/complete")
    .then()
    .statusCode(200);
  assertThat(Task.findById(toSetComplete.id).await().
    indefinitely(),
    // verify that the task in the database is updated and the complete field is set to a non-null value
    allOf(
      hasProperty("complete", notNullValue()),
      hasProperty("version", is(toSetComplete.version + 1))
    ));
}
```

### Testing optimistic lock
The version field of an entity is used by Hibernate to provide the optimistic locking features. We can also implement a test to verify that optimistic locking works and concurrent entity modifications are prevented by our application. 
```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "admin")
void updateOptimisticLock() {
  given()
  // providing a fake version number that doesn’t match the one in the database 
    .body("{\"name\":\"updated\",\"version\":1337}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .when().put("/api/v1/users/0")
    .then()
    // checking that it fails
    .statusCode(409);
}
```
### Update when not exist
```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "admin")
void updateNotFound() {
    given()
      .body("{\"name\":\"i-dont-exist\",\"password\":\"pa33\"}")
      .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
      .when().put("/api/v1/users/1337")
      .then()
      .statusCode(404);
}
```




## DELETE
This test verifies that a user with an administrative role can delete an existing user from the database. 
```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "admin")
void delete() {
//  creating a user object that we want to delete
  var toDelete = given()
    .body("{\"name\":\"to-delete\",\"password\":\"test\"}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    .post("/api/v1/users")
    .as(User.class);
  given()
    .when().delete("/api/v1/users/" + toDelete.id)
    .then()
    //verify that the server responds with a 204 No Content successful status code
    .statusCode(204);
    // verify that the user is no longer exist in the DB
  assertThat(User.findById
    (toDelete.id).await().indefinitely(), nullValue());
}
```

## Other Use Case

### Testing the password change feature
This test verifies that any application user can change their password using the provided endpoint. The following snippet contains the source code for this test:
```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "admin", roles = "user")
void changePassword() {
// preparing the request
  given()
    .body("{\"currentPassword\": \"quarkus\",
      \"newPassword\": \"changed\"}")
    .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    // sending the request
    .when().put("/api/v1/users/self/password")
    .then()
    .statusCode(200);
    // check that the user’s password was changed in the database and set to the corresponding bcrypt encrypted value
  assertTrue(BcryptUtil.matches("changed",
    User.<User>findById(0L).await().indefinitely().password)
  );
}
```


### Cascading delete

This test verifies that a user can delete one of their projects and that any task assigned to the project is reassigned so that it no longer references the deleted project. 

```
@Test
@TestSecurity(user = "user", roles = "user")
void delete() {
	// creating a project and a dependent task using real HTTP requests
	//creating the project 
  var toDelete = given().body("{\"name\":\"to-delete\"}").
    contentType(ContentType.JSON)
    // saving the project
    .post("/api/v1/projects").as(Project.class);
    // creating a task
  var dependentTask = given()
    .body("{\"title\":\"dependent-task\",\"project\":
      {\"id\":" + toDelete.id + "}}").contentType
        (ContentType.JSON)
        //saving the task
    .post("/api/v1/tasks").as(Task.class);
  given()
  // HTTP DELETE request
    .when().delete("/api/v1/projects/" + toDelete.id)
    .then()
    .statusCode(204);
    // verify that the dependent task stored in the database no longer references the deleted project
  assertThat(Task.<Task>findById(dependentTask.id).await().
    indefinitely().project, nullValue());
}
```
