- **HTML Comments**: Syntax: `<!-- Comment goes here -->`. Used to add notes or labels in the code without displaying them on the page.


## Live Server & Prettier
- **Local DEV server**: A server used for local development to preview websites. It allows for live reloading and can be accessed through the loopback address or localhost.
- **Live Server**: An extension for Visual Studio Code that serves as a local DEV server with live reloading capabilities. Commands include installing it from the extensions tab, running the server via the "go live" button or right-clicking to open with live server, and stopping the server by clicking on the port number.

## Meta Tags & Search Engines

- **IDs**: Used for unique identification, commonly used in JavaScript for dynamic functionality. Serves also as unique identifiers used for navigating inside the webpage (to jump to section).
- **CSS selectors**: Target elements based on classes or IDs for styling.

## Semantic Elements
- **Semantic Markup**: The use of HTML tags to reinforce the meaning of information in web pages rather than just defining its appearance.
- **HTML5**: Introduced new semantic tags and elements to make writing semantic markup easier.
- **Semantic Tags**: Tags that describe the content they contain, such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` tags.

## Global Attributes
- Global attributes are common to all HTML elements. They can be used on any element, though effects may vary.
- They enhance interactivity and accessibility in web applications but should be used judiciously, especially inline styles and scripts which are better handled separately with CSS and JavaScript.


1. **class** Used to assign a class to an element for styling and JavaScript interactions.
2. **id**: Assigns a unique identifier to an element. IDs should be unique within the document.
3. **style**: Allows inline CSS properties directly in HTML (not recommended).
4. **accesskey**: Defines keyboard shortcuts for activating or focusing on an element. The browser window should be active, and on windows you click on shift + alt + accesskey.
5. **title**: Provides additional information about an element (displayed as a tooltip).
6. **hidden**: Hides an element from view.
7. **tabindex**: Controls the order of focus when using the Tab key.
8. **contenteditable**: Makes an element editable by users (changes do not persist without JavaScript).
9. **draggable**: Enables dragging of elements within the page. For fully implemet it you need JS API.
10. **autofocus**:  Automatically focuses on an input field when the page loads.

  ```html
  <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <button title="Home Button" accesskey="H" onclick="alert('Home button clicked')">Home</button>
   <div hidden>This is a hidden div.</div>

   <button tabindex="3">Button One</button>
   <button tabindex="2">Button Two</button>
   <button tabindex="1">Button Three</button>

    <div contenteditable="true">This is an editable div.</div>

    <div draggable="true">Drag me!</div>

    <input type="text" autofocus />


  ```


## Popover & Details
The introduction of popovers and details elements enhances HTML's capability by enabling interactivity without requiring JavaScript. This makes it easier for developers to create functional web pages while focusing primarily on markup.

### Popovers
A popover is a small overlay that appears on top of other content when triggered, typically by a button click.
- **Functionality**: You can toggle the visibility of the popover content using just HTML attributes.
  
```html
<button popover-target="popover-1">Open Popover One</button>
<div id="popover-1" popover>This is Popover One.</div>
```

### Details Element
The details element creates a disclosure widget that allows users to access additional information or controls, functioning like a dropdown menu.
- **Usage Scenario**: Ideal for FAQs where clicking on a question reveals its answer.
1. Use the `<details>` tag to create a collapsible section.
2. Inside it, include a `<summary>` tag that contains the clickable text which expands or collapses the details.

```html
<details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
    <p>This is additional information revealed upon clicking.</p>
</details>
```

## Progress & Meter

The `<progress>` and `<meter>` elements provide straightforward ways to visualize progress and measurements in web applications. 

### The `<progress>` Element
- **Purpose**: Displays the progress of a task (e.g., file upload).
- **Attributes**:
  - `max`: Specifies the maximum value.
  - `value`: Indicates the current value.
- **Example Implementation**:
    ```html
    <label for="file">File Progress</label>
    <progress id="file" max="100" value="50">50%</progress>
    ```
- **Accessibility**: Text can be added inside for screen readers, ensuring better accessibility.

### The `<meter>` Element
- **Purpose**: Shows a measurement within a known range (e.g., fuel level).
- **Attributes**:
  - `min`: Minimum numeric value.
  - `max`: Maximum numeric value.
  - `low`: Lower bound of the acceptable range.
  - `high`: Upper bound of the acceptable range.
  - `optimum`: Indicates the optimal value.
- **Example Implementation**:
    ```html
    <label for="fuel">Fuel</label>
    <meter id="fuel" min="0" max="100" low="30" high="90" optimum="80" value="50">50 out of 100</meter>
    ```

## Styling with CSS
- The appearance of both elements can be styled using CSS, including pseudo-elements for customizations.
- The styling can dynamically change based on the values set within the defined ranges. For instance, if a meter's value is below or above its defined limits, its color can change to indicate this.
- Example CSS to change background color based on meter values. It will be violet only if the value is between the low and the high values
    ```css
    meter::-webkit-meter-optimum-value {
        background-color: violet;
    }
    ```
