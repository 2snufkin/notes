# Implementing CSS


## Methods of Implementing CSS

### 1. Inline CSS
Inline CSS allows you to apply styles directly within an HTML tag using the `style` attribute.
- **Example**:
    ```html
    <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 50px;">Hello World</h1>
    <p style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    ```
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Can lead to messy HTML code if used extensively.
  - Only applies styles to individual elements rather than globally.

### 2. Internal CSS
Internal CSS involves adding styles within `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
- **Example**:
    ```html
    <head>
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: blue;
                font-size: 50px;
            }
            p {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    ```
- **Advantages**:
  - Separates styling from content better than inline styles.
  
### 3. External CSS (Recommended)
External CSS keeps styles in a separate file (commonly named `style.css`) and links it to the HTML document using a `<link>` tag.
- **Example of Linking External File**:
    ```html
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
    </head>
    ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Maintains cleaner HTML code.
  - Allows for reusability across multiple pages by linking the same stylesheet.

# Basic CSS Selectors

### 1. **Type Selectors**
- Directly select HTML elements (e.g., `h2`, `p`, `div`).
- Example:
  ```css
  h2 {
      color: red;
      font-size: 30px;
  }
  ```

### 2. **Class Selectors**
- Use classes to style specific elements.
- Defined with a period (`.`) before the class name.
- Example:
  ```html
  <h2 class="sporty">Keep it sporty</h2>
  ```
  
```css
.sporty {
    color: red;
}
```

### 3. **ID Selectors**
- Unique identifiers for single elements, prefixed with a hash (`#`).
- Recommended for specific cases like linking or connecting labels to inputs.
- Example:
  ```html
  <div id="container"></div>
  ```
  
```css
#container {
    max-width: 600px;
    margin: auto;
}
```

### 4. **Multiple Selectors**
- Apply the same styles to different elements by separating them with commas.
- Example:
```css
.sporty, .casual {
    font-size: 35px;
}
```

### 5. **Descendant Selectors**
- Target elements within a specific parent element using a space between selectors.
- Example:
```css
#container p {
    background-color: blue;
}
```

### 6. **Global Styles**
- Use the `body` tag for global styles that affect all child elements.
- Common practice includes setting the font family.
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 
}
```
  
**Important Reminders**:
- Specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element. More specific selectors (e.g., `#container p`) take precedence over less specific ones (e.g., `p`).
- Inheritable properties include fonts but not borders; If you want them to apply also to children and granschildren use universal selectors if necessary but be cautious of their implications on layout.
- Favor classes over IDs for styling purposes.
- Always consider specificity when applying styles in CSS.
- Global styles can significantly simplify your stylesheet management by providing consistent formatting across your web page.



# Fonts In CSS
Fonts play a crucial role in web design by affecting readability and aesthetics. Understanding how to properly implement fonts using CSS is essential for creating visually appealing websites.

## Font Categories
1. **System/Web Safe Fonts**
   - These are default fonts installed on users' devices. Designed for high readability.
   - Common examples include: 
     - Arial
     - Verdana
     - Tahoma
     - Times New Roman
     - Georgia

2. **Web Fonts**
   - Need to be imported into a project.
   - Can be imported to the CSS file via the `@font-face` rule or @import.
   - Can be imported to the HTML file via <link> 
   - Popular choices include:
     - Poppins
     - Roboto
     - Montserrat
     - Open Sans

## Using Google Fonts
- You can find web fonts at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
- To use a font (e.g., Poppins):
  1. Select the desired styles/weights (e.g., 300, 400, 500).
  2. Copy the provided `<link>` tags or `@import` code.
  3. Place the `<link>` tag in your HTML file above the stylesheet link.

### Example Code Snippet:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Implementing Fonts in CSS
- Set the font family in your CSS file:
```css
body {
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
}
```
- Always provide a fallback option (e.g., `sans-serif`) in case the primary font is unavailable.

### Font Weights:
- Default weight is typically `400`.
- Use lighter weights (e.g., `300`) for specific text elements like paragraphs.
  
### Example Font Weight Usage:
```css
p {
    font-weight: 300; /* Lighter weight */
}
```

## Differences Between Serif and Sans-serif Fonts
- **Serif:** Has small lines or decorative features at the ends of strokes (e.g., Times New Roman).
- **Sans-serif:** Clean lines without additional embellishments (e.g., Arial, Poppins).



# Font & Text Properties

### 1. **Font Family**
- Defines the typeface used for the text.
- Can include multiple options as a fallback (e.g., `font-family: 'Poppins', Arial, sans-serif;`).

### 2. **Font Size**
- Specifies the size of the font.
- Units can be specified in pixels (`px`), relative units like `rem`, or keywords such as `small`, `medium`, etc.
- Example: 
  ```css
  h2 {
      font-size: 30px; // Also possible with 'large', 'x-large', etc.
  }
  ```

### 3. **Font Weight**
- Controls the thickness of characters.
- Common values:
  - `300`: Light
  - `400`: Regular
  - `600`: Semi-bold
  - `700`: Bold

### 4. **Font Style**
- Determines whether the text is italicized or normal.
- Default is normal, but can be set to italic:
    ```css
    font-style: italic;
    ```

### 5. **Font Variant**
- Used primarily for small caps, where only the first letter of each word appears larger and in uppercase:
    ```css
    font-variant: small-caps;
    ```

### 6. **Shorthand Property**
- Combines several font-related properties into one declaration:
    ```css
    font: italic small-caps bold 26px Arial;
    ```

## Text Properties

### 7. **Text Decoration**
- Adds decorations like underline or line-through:
    ```css
    text-decoration: none; // Removes underline from links by default
    ```

### 8. **Text Transform**
- Changes the case of text without altering HTML markup:
    - Options include:
        - `uppercase`
        - `lowercase`
        - `capitalize`
  
### 9. **Text Indent**
- Indents the first line of a block of text:
   ```css
   text-indent: 20px;
   ```

### 10. **Letter Spacing & Word Spacing**
- Adjusts spacing between letters and words respectively:
   ```css
   letter-spacing: 2px; 
   word-spacing: 5px;
   ```

### 11. **Text Align**
- Aligns text within its container (left, center, right):

   ```css
   text-align: center; 
   ```
#### Doesn't effect
- text-align only affects inline **content** within a block-level element. It does not affect the alignment of the block element itself. 
- text-align has no effect on elements that do not contain inline elements or text.
- For elements that are absolutely positioned (i.e., with position: absolute;), text-align generally does not affect their alignment.
- If you are using CSS Flexbox or Grid, the text-align property will have no effect on the flex or grid containers or items.

### 12. **Line Height**
- Sets space between lines of text, often applied to body elements for consistency:
   ```css
   line-height: normal; // Can also use numbers like "1.6" which is the same as 1.6rem, which means multiple the size of font-size of the html tag by 1.6
   ```
  
## Additional Notes on Units

1. **Relative Units**:
   - Use rem (root em) and em units for responsive design.
     - Rem is based on the root HTML element's font size.
     - Em is based on the parent element's font size.

2. When setting line height using relative units (e.g., `line-height:1.6;`), it multiplies with the base font size (usually defaults to `16px`). 


# Colors (Color Names, HEX, RGB, HSL)

### 1. **Color Properties**
- **Text Color**: Specified using the `color` property.
- **Background Color**: Defined using `background-color` or `background`.
- **Borders and Outlines**: Can also be colored.
- **Shadows**: Both box shadows and text shadows can have colors.
- **SVG Fill Colors**: Fill colors can be specified for scalable vector graphics (SVG).

### 2. **Color Names**
- There are approximately **147 predefined color names** available in CSS (e.g., red, blue, coral).
- A comprehensive list of these names can be found at [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).

### 3. **Hexadecimal (Hex) Codes**
- Hex codes consist of six characters representing the intensity of red (`RR`), green (`GG`), and blue (`BB`) respectively.
  - Format: `#RRGGBB`
  - Range for each pair is from `00` (no intensity) to `FF` (maximum intensity).
  - Shortened format is allowed when all three pairs are identical (e.g., `#FFF` for white).
  - The letters represnts the intensity greater than 9. A represnt 10, B 11 etc till F that represents 15.
### 4. **RGB Values**
- RGB values consist of three integers ranging from 0 to 255:
- 0 means no intensity and 255 is the max intensity.
  - Format: `rgb(RR, GG, BB)`
  - Example:
    - Black: `rgb(0, 0, 0)`
    - White: `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
    - Red: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`

### 5. **RGBA Values**
- RGBA extends RGB by adding an alpha channel for transparency:
  - Format: `rgba(RR, GG, BB, A)`
    - A ranges from `0` (completely transparent) to `1` (completely opaque).
  
### 6. **HSL Values**
- HSL stands for Hue Saturation Lightness:
   - Format: `hsl(Hue°, Saturation%, Lightness%)`
   - Hue ranges from `0° to 360°`, while saturation and lightness range from `0% to 100%`.

### 7. **HSLA Values**
- HSLA extends HSL with an alpha channel for transparency:
   - Format: `hsla(Hue°, Saturation%, Lightness%, A)`

### Important Notes
- When using colors in code:
   - Maintain consistency across your project; avoid mixing different methods of color specification unless necessary.
   - Use specific properties like `background-color`, rather than just generic terms like 'background', for clarity.


# CSS Specificity
CSS specificity is a crucial concept that determines which styles are applied to elements when multiple declarations target the same element. Understanding how specificity works can help prevent conflicts in your stylesheets and ensure that the intended styles take effect.
- When two or more rules apply to the same element, the rule with higher specificity will take precedence.
- If two rules have equal specificity, the one declared last in the stylesheet will be applied.

1. **Specificity Hierarchy**:
   - **!important flag**: Highest specificity. 
   - **Inline CSS**: Higher specificity. Styles defined directly on an element using the `style` attribute will override any other styles.
   - **ID Selector**: Higher specificity than class or element selectors. An ID can be used to style a unique element.
   - **Class Selector**: More specific than an element selector but less specific than an ID.
   - **Element Selector**: Has the lowest specificity.

2. **Applying Styles**:

### Example of Specificity in Action
Arranged from the hifhest to the lowest

```css
h1 { color: black !important; } /* Overrides all because of the !important flag */
#heading { color: purple; } /* Specificity: 100 (ID selector) */
.container h1 { color: blue; } /* Specificity: 011 (class selector + element selector) */
.heading { color: green; } /* Specificity: 010 (class selector) */
h1 { color: red; } /* Specificity: 001 (element selector) */

```

### Important Flags
- The `!important` declaration gives a style rule highest priority, even over inline styles unless another rule also has `!important` and higher specificity.
- Use `!important` sparingly as it can make maintaining CSS difficult.

## Best Practices
- Avoid excessive use of inline CSS and `!important`.
- Organize your CSS to minimize conflicts by following a clear structure for selectors.
- Third-party styles may require special handling, sometimes necessitating the use of `!important` for overrides.

# Backgrounds
How to use background properties in CSS, including: background colors, images, and gradients. 

### 1. **Background Color**
- Background color can be set using either `background` or `background-color`.
- Example:
  ```css
  .hero {
      background-color: coral; /* Sets the background color */
      /* background: coral;  Sets the background color */
  }
  ```

### 2. **Background Image**
- Background images are set using `background-image` or simply `background`.
- Syntax for setting a background image:
  ```css
  .hero {
      background-image: url('./hero.jpeg');
  }
  ```
- **Properties**
In most cases you will want to define the repeat to no repeat, the size for cover and the position to center. 
    - **Background Size**: Controls the size of the image.
        - Set to specific pixels or use `cover` to fill the entire area.
        ```css
        background-size: cover; /* Ensures image covers the container */
        ```
    - **Background Repeat**: Controls whether the image repeats.
        - Set to `no-repeat` to prevent repetition.
    - **Background Position**: Adjusts where the image is placed within the container.
        ```css
        background-position: center; /* Centers the image */
        background-position: 200px 500px; /* Push the image down 500px and to the right 200px */
        ```
      - **Background Attachment**: Controls whether the background scrolls with the page content. Default is `scroll`; change to `fixed` to keep it stationary during scrolling.
        ```css
        background-attachment: fixed; /*  keep it stationary during scrollin */
        ```    

### 3. **Shorthand Property**
- A shorthand version allows combining multiple properties into one line:
  ```css
  .hero {
      background: url('./hero.jpeg') no-repeat center / cover;
  }
  ```

### 4. **Background Attachment**
- Controls whether the background scrolls with the page content.
    - Default is `scroll`; change to `fixed` to keep it stationary during scrolling.

### 5. **Gradients**
- Gradients can be created using `linear-gradient`.
    - Syntax includes direction and color stops:
    ```css
    .hero {
        background: linear-gradient(to bottom, lightblue, darkblue); /*  The first arg is the direction */
    }
    ```
- Directions can vary (e.g., `to left`, `to bottom left`, etc.).



# Styling Links
Links can exist in several states which can be styled individually:

1. **Normal (Unvisited) Link**: The default appearance of a link.
2. **Hover State**: The style applied when the mouse hovers over the link.
3. **Active State**: The moment the link is clicked.
4. **Focus State**: When the link has received focus (e.g., via keyboard navigation), to exist the focus state the user need to click with the mouse elsewhere.
5. **Visited State**: The style for links that have been previously clicked.

### Example HTML Structure
To demonstrate styling, an example HTML structure is used:
```html
<p>Check out our <a href="#">latest blog post</a>.</p>
```

### CSS Styling

- **Normal Link Style**:
  ```css
  a {
      text-decoration: none; /* Removes underline */
      color: #333; /* Dark gray color */
  }
  ```

- **Hover State Style**:
  ```css
  a:hover {
      color: red; /* Changes text color to red on hover */
  }
  ```

- **Active State Style**:
  ```css
  a:active {
      background-color: purple; /* Background changes to purple when clicked */
  }
  ```

- **Focus State Style**:
  ```css
  a:focus {
      background-color: yellow; /* Background changes to yellow when focused */
  }
  ```

- **Visited State Style**:
  ```css
  a:visited {
      color: coral; /* Changes color to coral for visited links */
  }
  ```

### Important Notes
- The most commonly styled states are Normal and Hover.
- Active state styles are visible only briefly during clicking.
- Focus state remains until the user clicks away from the link.


# Font Awesome Library

Font Awesome is a widely-used icon library that allows developers to easily integrate icons into their projects without the need to create them from scratch. It offers both free and premium versions, with a large collection of free icons available for use.
- **Website**: [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com)
- **Versions**: Offers both a **Pro (premium)** version and a substantial amount of **free icons**.
  
### 2. Finding Icons
- Icons can be browsed by category or searched using keywords (e.g., "check").
- Free icons do not require a Pro account.
- Each icon comes with specific class names to be used in HTML.

### 3. Usage
- Icons are implemented using `<i>` tags along with Font Awesome classes:
  - Example classes include `fas` (Font Awesome Solid) and `fab` (Font Awesome Brands).
- The icons function like fonts, allowing for styling such as color and size adjustments.

### 4. Including Font Awesome in Projects
#### Using CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- Easily include the library via CDN:
  - Go to [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com), search for Font Awesome, select the desired version, and copy the link tag.
  
#### Manual Download
- Alternatively, download the CSS file along with font files if you prefer not to use CDN.

### 5. Example Implementation
```html
<!-- Link to Font Awesome -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="URL_TO_FONT_AWESOME_CSS">

<!-- Adding an icon -->
<h3>Icon Examples</h3>
<i class="fas fa-check"></i>
<i class="fas fa-times"></i>
```

### 6. Customizing Icon Appearance
- The icon is basically like a Font (hence the name Font Awesome), you can change colors and sizes using CSS:
```css
.fa-facebook {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 50px; /* Adjust size */
}
```
- Use premade size classes like `fa-xs`, `fa-lg`, `fa-2x` ( up to `fa-10x`), etc.
