# How The Web Works
- The web works with a client-server model where the client (browser) makes requests to the server over HTTP.
- When a URL is entered in the browser, it gets converted to an IP address through DNS.
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a language that allows communication between clients and servers.
- HTTP is stateless, meaning each request-response cycle is independent.
- Status codes like 200 (successful response) and 404 (not found) are important in HTTP.
- Different types of requests include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (delete data).
- Browsers make multiple requests for resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files when rendering a webpage.

# The Roles Of HTML, CSS & JS In Web Development
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** is used for structuring web pages semantically, with elements represented by tags.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** is used for styling and presenting HTML elements on the screen, including colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and animations.
- **JavaScript:** is a programming language that adds interactivity to web pages through dynamic elements like buttons, sliders, modals, popups, form validation, and more.
- HTML serves as the skeleton of the Frontend web, while JavaScript provides behavior and CSS handles style.


# Tools
- To create websites and write HTML and CSS, you need a web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge Brave.
- A text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is required to write code. Visual Studio Code is recommended for web development.
- Install extensions like Live Server and Prettier in Visual Studio Code for enhanced functionality.
- Use the command palette (Command/Control + Shift + P) in Visual Studio Code to search for commands and actions.
- Install themes in Visual Studio Code through the Extensions tab.
- Enable "Format on Save" option in Visual Studio Code to automatically format code when saving files.
- Git is a version control system essential for collaboration, backup, and versioning of code. Learn basic Git commands and set up repositories on GitHub for deployment.
- Download Git from get-scm.com and use Git Bash terminal program on Windows or default terminals on Mac/Linux.
- Basic terminal commands include "ls" to list files/folders. More terminal and Git commands will be covered later in the course.
