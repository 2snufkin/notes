When building a responsive web application, it's crucial to use media queries to adapt the layout and design to different screen sizes. Here are some common media queries you should consider:

1. **General Responsive Layout:**
   - Adjust the layout for various screen sizes.
   ```css
   @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
     /* Styles for small screens */
   }
   ```

2. **Tablet Landscape:**
   - Modify styles for tablets in landscape mode.
   ```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
     /* Styles for tablets in landscape mode */
   }
   ```

3. **Tablet Portrait:**
   - Customize styles for tablets in portrait mode.
   ```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px) {
     /* Styles for tablets in portrait mode */
   }
   ```

4. **Mobile Landscape:**
   - Adjust styles for mobile devices in landscape mode.
   ```css
   @media screen and (max-width: 480px) and (orientation: landscape) {
     /* Styles for mobile devices in landscape mode */
   }
   ```

5. **Mobile Portrait:**
   - Customize styles for mobile devices in portrait mode.
   ```css
   @media screen and (max-width: 480px) and (orientation: portrait) {
     /* Styles for mobile devices in portrait mode */
   }
   ```

6. **Large Screens:**
   - Optimize styles for larger screens (e.g., desktops).
   ```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
     /* Styles for larger screens */
   }
   ```

These are just examples, and you can adjust the specific breakpoints and styles based on your application's design and layout requirements. Always test your responsive design on various devices to ensure a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
