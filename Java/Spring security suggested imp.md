Spring Security's `AuthenticationProvider` is an interface, not a class. When you create a custom authentication provider in Spring Security, you need to implement the `AuthenticationProvider` interface by providing your own implementation for the required methods.

The `AuthenticationProvider` interface is part of the Spring Security framework, and it is designed to handle the authentication process. Here are the key methods you need to implement:

1. `authenticate(Authentication authentication)`: This method performs authentication based on the provided `Authentication` object, which typically contains the username and password.

2. `supports(Class<?> authentication)`: This method indicates whether the `AuthenticationProvider` supports a specific authentication class. For example, it might support `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` or some custom token.

When you implement a custom authentication provider, you are free to create your own class that implements the `AuthenticationProvider` interface. Here is an example:

```java
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationProvider;
import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
import org.springframework.security.core.AuthenticationException;

public class CustomAuthenticationProvider implements AuthenticationProvider {

    @Override
    public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {
        // Your authentication logic goes here
        return null; // Return an authenticated Authentication object or throw an AuthenticationException if authentication fails
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class<?> authentication) {
        // Specify the authentication class that this provider supports
        return authentication.equals(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class);
    }
}
```

In the above example, `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is used as an example authentication class. You should adjust the `supports` method to reflect the authentication class that your provider supports.

When configuring this custom authentication provider in your Spring Security XML or Java configuration, you'll reference the bean that represents your implementation of the `AuthenticationProvider`.
