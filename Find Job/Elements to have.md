# Network
You are as powerful as your network. it is so important to
form bonds and connections with people whenever you can because one day, they could help you in ways you could never imagine. Network with fellow developers, hiring managers, CEOs, job seekers,
accountants, and recruiters. All of these people are potential gateways to getting you into the industry.
look for jobs that are best for you by knowing your career objectives and applying to particular job openings
your network can be divided into online netwrok and offline
1. LinkedIn:  is a fantastic resource for staying current on what’s available and how to match it to your ambitions. Being active on the platform and engaging
with other job seekers and hiring managers leads to more success
2. Job boards: Glassdoor, welcome to the jungle etc...
3. Job Fairs: Attending job fairs and workshops or conversing with people
in your industry are examples of offline networking. Job fairs and professional gatherings are excellent places to get your job search going or learn more
about the kinds of occupations that could be ideal for you. By taking advantage of these possibilities, you can meet hiring managers, influential people, and other people who can help you network effectively
4. Meetups: Meetups can be a priceless resource for us when looking for referrals that could lead to our next position. Meetups offer excellent chances for networking with experts in your area and creating meaningful
connections that might result in recommendations for job openings. You could
meet people who can introduce you to others or provide you access to employers.
5. referrals: Look at the individuals who are already a part of your network, such
as friends or acquaintances, to start. It’s crucial that you pick a person who is knowledgeable about
your qualifications and network. ask them if they are aware of any openings or employment that
match your qualifications.

# Targeted Search
You can keep a list of  potential companies, you could research more information about company cultures, job vacancies, and other factors. LinkedIn is a fantastic tool for conducting company research as well; in addition to finding comprehensive company information, you can connect with hiring managers and current workers in the business.

# Job description
Look for areas that mention qualifications, education,
skills, experience..You don’t always need to meet all the specifications. In fact, it’s quite
common for people to get hired even when they don’t possess all of the skills and experience. Keep a look out for those ATS keywords because the more of them that you find, the better your
chances of getting to an interview. Look for factors are related to work-life balance, and if we want to have a healthy mental state, then they need
serious consideration.

# Resume
+ Experience: 3-4 bullet points tend to be the most effective way to describe each job role. what you did in the role and how it had a positive effect on the business. Avoid writing paragraphs because they will make your resume too long, and hiring managers are more likely to avoid them because it slows down their shortlisting process.
+ Education: Any college or university degrees that we hold should be presented there. Mentioning any certifications, courses, and training can add further weight to our profile.
+ Skills: use keywords that highlight your skills and experiences in relation to the job that you are applying for. it’s best to include both hard and soft skills.
Hard skills include programming-related areas such as JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Soft skills, on the other hand, include areas such as communication, teamwork, pro activeness, and so on. use keywords that highlight your
skills and experiences in relation to the job that you are applying for

## Avoid
1. spelling and grammatical mistakes
2. non esstinal information: an introduction
paragraph that explains who we are and what we are looking for. This belongs on the cover letter, not the resume. personal hobbies can be removed too

## Resume types


1. **Chronological Resume:**
The most popular
   - **Structure:** Lists work experience in reverse chronological order (most recent job first).
   - **Focus:** Highlights a candidate's career progression and demonstrates a clear timeline of work history.

2. **Functional Resume:**
Functional resume concentrates on your talents and competencies. Some hiring managers might be wary of this style since it may be seen as an effort to hide a lack of experience or employment gaps.
   - **Structure:** Organized by skills and qualifications rather than a chronological list of jobs.
   - **Focus:** Emphasizes skills and abilities rather than the chronological order of work experience.
	 - **Suited For:** those with employment gaps or changing careers, as it allows them to showcase relevant skills.

3. **Combination Resume (or Hybrid Resume):**

A combination resume may also start with a summary or objective statement that highlights the applicant’s significant accomplishments and career objectives
   - **Structure:** Blends elements of both chronological and functional resumes, typically starting with a skills summary followed by a chronological work history.
   - **Focus:** Balances showcasing skills with a clear timeline of work experience.
   - **Suited For:**  job seekers with a varied work history, this style is especially helpful because it highlights both their previous experience and talents.

A good method to highlight a candidate’s skills and raise their chances of getting called in for an interview

## Why Customize?
Tailor-made resumes leading to more interviews compared to the generic ones
If you create a tailor-made resume and cover letter for each role you apply for, then you can demonstrate that you have taken the time to read through their job description and that you are capable of showcasing how your current technology stack is a perfect match for the job.

The main purpose of having a resume in the first place is to present your knowledge and qualifications, to convince a hiring manager that you are a candidate worth shortlisting.
Cover letters,  not as formal as a resume, your chance to introduce yourself to the company and explain why above all else you are the stand-out candidate they should seriously consider hiring.  a potential good culture fit and that we deserve
to be invited for an interview

other inaccuracies, then we are highly unlikely to get to the interview stage

# Cover letter

Cover letters let us express ourselves in a more informal way, which is usually not a possibility on a resume, which has to be more formal. 
who you are, what you can do, and why you are applying for the role at that company.

an email and selling our skills, brand, and personality to a potential new company that is looking for
new hires.

## Avoid

2. Duplication: Another area to be concerned about is duplication. Our cover letters should supplement, not rehash, our resume. 
3. Put emphasis on how you can benefit the company, not on what
you want in return.
4. Wrong tone : Figuring out which tone of voice to use when you write can be
challenging as well. Work on matching the way the company comes across; striking the right balance between formal and informal is important

Structure:
