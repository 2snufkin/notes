# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are software development practices that aim to streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. 

**CI Pipeline:** Build, unit test, integration tests
**CD Pipeline:** Code review, staging, production

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. The primary goal of CI is to detect and address integration issues as early as possible by automatically building and testing the code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Benefits of CI include:
- Early detection of integration problems.
- Faster identification and resolution of bugs.
- Improved collaboration among developers.
- Consistent and automated testing procedures.

### Configuration The .yaml File
There are template for each dev langauage in this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)

**Java example**
```yaml
name: Java CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn --batch-mode --update-snapshots package

```


## Continuous Deployment (CD)

The job of the deploment job is simple: 
+ Download the artifacts from the build job (they must be uploaded)
+ Deploy them

### Configuration The .yaml File
Instead of creating a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying your application try and (serach)[https://github.com/marketplace?category=deployment&type=actions] for a one that exists that suits your needs 

if you didn't find an already lade action, you can write your own. 

**CD config example**
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to Azure App Service
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main  # Adjust to your main branch name

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'

         - name: Install Dependencies and Build
           run: |
             npm ci
             npm run build  # Adjust to your build script

         - name: Deploy to Azure
           uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
           with:
             app-name: <your-app-name>
             publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
   ```


# Example for a java workflow
Below is a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file that automates the build and release process for your open source project. This workflow will trigger the compilation of the project on every push to any branch and create a new release whenever a Git tag is pushed.

Save this YAML configuration as `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Build and Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '*'
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Project
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Set up Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '8'  # Adjust the Java version as needed
          
      - name: Build Project
        run: mvn clean install  # Adjust this to match your Maven build command
        
      - name: Archive Artifact
        run: zip -r artifact.zip ./target  # Adjust this to match your Maven build output directory

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: release-artifact
          path: artifact.zip

  release:
    name: Create Release
    needs: build
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Download Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: release-artifact
          path: .
          
      - name: Create GitHub Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: |
            Release created by GitHub Actions
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
          
      - name: Upload Artifact to Release
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./artifact.zip
          asset_name: artifact.zip
          asset_content_type: application/zip

```

Make sure to adjust the configuration according to your project's build process, file structure, and any specific requirements you might have. This workflow will automatically compile and release your project based on the triggers you mentioned.
