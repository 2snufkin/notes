# Building, Pushing, and Deploying Docker Containers

## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that contain all the dependencies needed for an application to run. This ensures consistency between development, testing, and production environments.

## Deploying Docker Containers with GitHub Actions

Below is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file for building and deploying Docker containers to a server when changes are pushed to the main branch:
The steps are:
1. Build the container: To build a Docker container, you need a Dockerfile that contains instructions for creating the container image.
2. Push the container: push the container image to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry. This allows you to store and share your container images with others.
3. Deploying the container

The following yaml define itslef the script to run but a better soultion maybe to use already pre-defined git actions that can be found in the git (action marketplace)[https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=&type=actions&verification=]
```yaml
name: Docker CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

        # Setting up Docker Buildx with docker-container driver is required so u can use the docker commends
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

        # Login to github registry. If you work with Azure you should log to Azure registry... 
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}


        # Build and push the docker container 
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: "{{defaultContext}}:mysubdir" # the actual path  where the Dockerfile and any other necessary files for building the Docker image are located. 
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest # you can include the commit hash in the tag, it will be always unique

      - name: SSH into deployment server and redeploy # This is for learning purpose. Use a pre-defined git action
      # that correspends you needs
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.SERVER_PASSWORD }}
          script: |
            docker stop my-node-app || true
            docker rm my-node-app || true
            docker pull your-dockerhub-username/my-node-app:latest
            docker run -d --name my-node-app -p 3000:3000 your-dockerhub-username/my-node-app:latest
```

This YAML file sets up a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on pushes to the main branch. It builds the Docker image, pushes it to Docker Hub, and then deploys the updated container to a remote server using SSH.
