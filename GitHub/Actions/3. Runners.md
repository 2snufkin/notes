# Introduction to GitHub Runners
Runners are essentially the execution environment (virtual machine or physical server) where your workflows are executed. 
 They can be hosted by GitHub (GitHub-hosted runners) or by you (self-hosted runners) on your own infrastructure. 

- **GitHub-Hosted Runners:** These are provided and maintained by GitHub that provide a clean instance for every job execution and destory it when the job is completed. They offer a variety of environments to choose from (such as Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions), making them easy to use and suitable for most workflows. Free for public repos, for private repos you will need to start to pay from a certain moment.

- **Self-Hosted Runners:** These runners run on your own infrastructure, giving you more control over the environment. You can customize the runner's software, hardware, and networking setup to meet the specific needs of your workflows.

## Self-Hosted Runner
While GitHub-hosted runners offer convenience and ease of use, there are several compelling reasons to opt for self-hosted runners in your GitHub Actions workflows:

### Why to use them?
1. Software dependency: Sometimes, your application may rely on specific software, libraries, or tools that are not available on GitHub-hosted runners
2. VM Size + Config: Self-hosted runners allow you to tailor the virtual machine's configuration to match your application's requirements precisely. You can choose the operating system, adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory), and configure other settings that optimize the build and test processes.
3. Secure Access & Networking: In scenarios where your workflows interact with resources that are accessible only within your organization's network, self-hosted runners provide a secure solution. These runners can be set up within your organization's firewall, allowing your workflows to access internal APIs or databases that are not publicly exposed.
4. Large Workload Support: GitHub-hosted runners have predefined resource limits based on the selected tier, which might not be sufficient for particularly resource-intensive workloads. With self-hosted runners, you have the flexibility to allocate more resources to handle larger workloads, ensuring faster and more efficient job execution.
5. Cost-Efficiency for Private Repositories: While GitHub-hosted runners are free for public repositories, there are usage limits and costs associated with private repositories.


### Adding a Self-Hosted Runner

Setting up a self-hosted runner involves a few steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Depending on the type of runner you're setting up (Linux, macOS, Windows), you'll need to install the required dependencies. These might include Docker, specific software libraries, and tools that your workflows rely on.

2. **Install GitHub Runner Application:** GitHub provides a runner application that you need to install on your self-hosted machine. This application handles the communication between your runner and GitHub's servers. You can download the runner application from the "Settings" > "Actions" > "Runners" section of your repository.
The installion is runnning a script on the virtual machine and not downloading a file.  

+ creating a directory and switch to it
+ downloading the file as a zip
+ compare the hash of the file t o check if the file was download correctly
+ exctrat the zip file

3. **Configure the Runner:** After installing the runner application, you'll need to configure it by providing authentication details and other settings. The runner will generate a unique token that associates it with your repository. This token ensures secure communication between the runner and GitHub.
+ create the runner: you will need to answer some questions: 
++ runnergroup (enter for default), name of the runner, additional labels, work folder (enter for default), isAsService? (would you like the run to run as a serivce when the virtual machine restarts, if it's a windows runner it makes sense to run as a service), user account to use


4. **Start the Runner:** Once configured, start the runner application. It will connect to GitHub's servers, ready to accept and execute jobs from your workflows.

### Deleting a Self-Hosted Runner

If you no longer need a self-hosted runner in your GitHub Actions setup, you can easily delete it using the following steps:

1. **Stop the Runner:**
   Before deleting a self-hosted runner, it's essential to stop the runner process that's currently running on the machine. You can do this by either stopping the runner service or terminating the runner application.

2. **Remove the Runner from Repository:**
   To remove the runner from a specific repository, follow these steps:
   
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Go to the "Settings" tab.
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Actions."
   - Under the "Runners" section, you'll find a list of runners associated with the repository. Click on the runner you want to remove.
   - On the runner's details page, click the "Remove" button. Confirm the action when prompted.
If you no longer intend to use self-hosted runners on a particular machine, you can uninstall the runner application altogether. You will get a script that will uninstall the runner on the VM and delete the service if you chosse to define it as a service

3. **Unconfigure the Runner:**
   After removing the runner from the repository, you should also unconfigure the runner on the machine where it was hosted. This step ensures that any tokens or configurations associated with the runner are properly cleaned up.

4. **Optional: Uninstall Runner Application:**
    You should ru

5. **Clean Up Resources:**
   If the self-hosted runner was running on a virtual machine or cloud instance, you may want to consider releasing any allocated resources associated with that machine to prevent unnecessary charges.

6. **Check Other Workflows:**
   If you had workflows specifically configured to run on the deleted self-hosted runner, make sure to adjust those workflows to target the appropriate runners to ensure your workflows continue to execute as expected.


### Running Jobs on Self-Hosted Runners

With your self-hosted runner in place, you can start running jobs using it:

1. **Workflow Configuration:** In your repository, create or modify a workflow configuration file (typically named `.github/workflows/main.yml`). Define the jobs, steps, and actions that you want to run.

2. **Specify Runner:** Within your workflow configuration, you can specify that certain jobs should run on your self-hosted runner. This is done using the `runs-on` key, where you'll specify the unique label associated with your self-hosted runner or list of labels.

3. **Trigger Workflow:** Workflows can be triggered by events such as pushes to your repository, pull requests, or other custom events. When an event triggers a workflow, GitHub will determine the runner that should execute the workflow based on your configuration.

4. **Monitor Execution:** You can monitor the progress of your workflow in real-time on the Actions tab of your GitHub repository. This includes information about each step of the workflow and any errors that occur.

By using self-hosted runners, you can tailor your GitHub Actions workflows to your specific needs, leverage your existing infrastructure, and ensure that sensitive data and processes remain within your controlled environment.

Remember that maintaining self-hosted runners involves regular updates and maintenance to ensure security, compatibility, and optimal performance.

### logs
inside the folder where you configurate your runner on the virtual machine you will find a subfolder named "_diag". In this folder there are txt log file that can help you in debugging
