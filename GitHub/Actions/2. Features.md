## Environment Variables

### User Made
Variables used for storing and accessing data across workflows and jobs. For example reusable configuration data. The scope of a variable is limited to the element that defines it (workflow/job/step level). They provide a convenient way to pass information securely.

```yaml
jobs:
  echo_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      MY_VARIABLE: "Hello, GitHub!"
    steps:
      - name: Print Variable
        run: echo $MY_VARIABLE # only Print Variable step can access this variable. you can define it in the global scope for global access
```
**Alternative Syntax**
The >> operator is used to append to the $GITHUB_ENV file, which sets the environment variable. The echo redirecting the output to the file $GITHUB_ENV file
```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Save to environment
        run:  echo " $MY_VARIABLE=Hello, GitHub!" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

#### Sharing Variables Between Steps and Jobs
GitHub allows you to share values between different steps and even between different jobs in a workflow using output variables.
In this example we share a value from job1 to job2

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      my_output: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.my_step_output }}
    steps:
      - name: Step 1
        id: step1
        run: echo "Hello from Step 1"
        # Output a value
        - name: Set Step Output
          # define a variable to share
          run: echo "::set-output name=my_step_output::value"
          
  job2:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step 2
        run: echo "Using output from Step 1: ${{ needs.job1.outputs.my_output}}"
```

### Default GitHub Variables

GitHub provides (default environment variables) [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables] that offer information about the repository, workflow, and run. These variables can be utilized for various purposes.\

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print Repository Name
        run: echo $GITHUB_REPOSITORY
```

### Secrets and Passwords

GitHub allows you to store sensitive information securely using secrets.Secrets and variables  Secrets are encrypted and are used for sensitive data.
Anyone with collaborator access to this repository can use these secrets (and variables) for actions. These secrets can then be accessed within your workflows but they are not passed to workflows that are triggered by a pull request from a fork. 

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use Secret
        run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}
```
**Defining secrets:** In gitHub website go to Setting => Secrets and variables => Actions and click on the button "New repository secret"


## Files: GitHub Artifacts
Artifacts in GitHub are a way to persist data after job has been completed and share the data with another job.

**Uploading:** you upload it so you can use it in **another** job.
**Downloading:** using the artifact in **another** job.

```yaml
name: Upload, Use and Restrict Artifact

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build: # the job that create and upload the artifact
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository # step 1
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build Artifact # step 2: creating the artifact
        run: |
          # Replace this with your build commands
          echo "Building artifact..."
          mkdir artifacts
          touch artifacts/my_artifact.txt
          
      - name: Upload Artifact # step 3: uploading the artifact so it can be used in the cleanup job later
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: my-artifact # the artifact name
          path: artifacts
          retention-days: 10 # it will be saved in github for 10 days. the default is 90 days

  cleanup: # I want to use the artifact that was created in another job so i will donload it
    needs: build # if build wont run, the artifact won't be uploaded
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download Artifact 
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: my-artifact # the artifact name i want to download
      - name: Read Artifacts
        run: cat my_artifact.txt

      
```

## Manual Approvals

Manual approvals in Git Actions allow you to introduce a human review step before a certain action or workflow can proceed.It ensures that critical changes go through a human verification step before being merged or deployed, contributing to a more robust and reliable software development lifecycle.

### How Manual Approvals Work

Manual approvals involve pausing a workflow and waiting for a manual trigger from a designated reviewer or team member. The workflow will remain in a "pending" state until the approval is given or rejected. Once the approval is received, the workflow will resume and continue with the defined steps.

### Adding Manual Approvals to a Workflow
in gitHub => Setting => Environment => click on New Environment => give it a name and click on Configure environment => select Required reviewers
