## JavaScript

- **JavaScript**: Lightweight, interpreted, not pre-compiled.
- **ECMAScript**: Standard for JS, ensuring compatibility across different browsers with different JS engines.
- **JS Engine**: Software component that executes JS.
- **Node**: A JS Engine outside the browser.
- **Browser Console**: Allows executing JS code within the browser.

**Where to include JS code:**
1. Before `</body>` tag.
2. Inside a `<script>` tag.
3. In an external file with a `src` attribute.

**Environment Setup:** 
Popular code editors for JS development include:
- Visual Studio
- Atom
- Sublime Text

**Extensions for Visual Studio:** 
- Live Server
- Material Icon
- Material Theme
- IntelliCode

**Variables:**
Avoid using `var`. Instead, use `let` or `const`.
- `let` is mutable and can be changed later on.
- Changing a `const` variable will result in a TypeError.

**Comments:**
- Use `//` for single-line comments.
- Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use camel case for variable and function names.
- Avoid using reserved names.

**Data Types:**
JavaScript supports the following data types:
- String
- Boolean
- Number
- Null
- Undefined
- Object (Arrays, Date, etc.)
- Symbol

**Strings:**
- Strings are immutable and cannot be modified directly.
- String creation options:
  1. Double quotes: `"..."`. Single quotes can be included within double quotes.
  2. Single quotes: `'...'`.
  3. Backticks: `` `...` ``. Allows variable embedding and multi-line strings.
- String length: Access the length using `stringVariable.length`.
- String Methods:
  - `indexOf()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a character or substring in a string. Returns -1 if not found.
  - `lastIndexOf()`: Returns the index of the last occurrence of a character or substring in a string.
  - `replace()`: Replaces only the first occurrence of a character or substring in a string.
  - `replaceAll()`: Replaces all occurrences of a character or substring in a string.
  - `substring()`: Returns a new string from a specified start index to a specified end index (excluding the end index).
  - `slice()`: Similar to `substring()`, but handles negative and out-of-range indices differently.
  - `startsWith()`: Checks if a string starts with a specified substring.
  - `endsWith()`: Checks if a string ends with a specified substring.
  - `includes()`: Checks if a string contains a specified substring.

**Numbers:**
- The `++` and `--` operators increment and decrement a variable by 1, respectively.
- The `+=` and `-=` operators add and subtract a value from a variable, respectively.
- `NaN`: Represents the result when a mathematical operation is performed on non-number variables. It indicates that the calculation couldn't be made.
  - The `+` operator concatenates strings instead of producing `NaN`. To concatenate strings with variables, use Template Literals.

**Template Literals:**
- Allow you to:
  1. Use variables inside a string using `${variable}` syntax.
  2. Write multi-line strings using backticks.
  
**Arrays**
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can contain elements of any data type.

**Creating Arrays:**
- Using square brackets: `let array = [element1, element2, ...];`
- Using the `Array` constructor: `let array = new Array(element1, element2, ...);`

**Accessing Array Elements:**
Array elements are accessed using zero-based indexing:
- `array[index]` returns the element at the specified index.

**Array Methods:**
- `length`: Returns the number of elements in an array.
- `push()`: Adds elements to the end of an array.
- `pop()`: Removes the last element from an array.
- `shift()`: Removes the first element from an array.
- `unshift()`: Adds elements to the beginning of an array.
- `indexOf()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element in an array.
- `splice()`: Changes the contents of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.

**Null and Undefined**

- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **Undefined**: Represents an uninitialized variable, missing function arguments, or missing object properties.

**Booleans and Comparisons**

Booleans are a data type that can have one of two values: `true` or `false`. They are often used in conditional statements and comparisons.

**Comparison Operators:**
- `==`: Equality operator. Compares values, converting the operands to a common type if necessary.
- `!=`: Inequality operator. Compares values, converting the operands to a common type if necessary.
- `===`: Strict equality operator. Compares values and types without type conversion.
- `!==`: Strict inequality operator. Compares values and types without type conversion.
- `>`: Greater than operator.
- `<`: Less than operator.
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to operator.
- `<=`: Less than or equal to operator.

#### Loose Versus Strict Comparison

**Loose Comparison:**
- Loose comparison (`==`) allows type coercion, meaning different types can be considered equal if their values are the same after conversion.
- Examples:
  - `1 == "1"` is `true` because the string "1" is converted to the number `1`.
  - `true == 1` is `true` because the boolean `true` is converted to the number `1`.

**Strict Comparison:**
- Strict comparison (`===`) does not allow type coercion and compares both value and type.
- Examples:
  - `1 === "1"` is `false` because the types are different (number vs. string).
  - `true === 1` is `false` because the types are different (boolean vs. number).

#### Type Conversion

Type conversion allows you to convert values from one data type to another.

**Implicit Conversion:**
- JavaScript automatically performs type conversion in certain situations, such as:
  - When using operators between different types.
  - When applying logical operators (`&&`, `||`) to non-boolean values.

**Explicit Conversion:**
- You can explicitly convert values between different types using conversion functions or methods, such as:
  - `String(value)`: Converts a value to a string.
  - `Number(value)`: Converts a value to a number.
  - `Boolean(value)`: Converts a value to a boolean.
