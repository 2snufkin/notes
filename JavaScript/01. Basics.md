**JavaScript**: lightwaight, interpreted, not pre-compiled.\
**ECMAScript**: standard for JS. So that JS will work the same on diffrent broswers that have diffrent JS engines.\
**JS Engine**: a software component that execute JS.\
*Node:* a JS Engine outside the browser.
*Browser Console:* you can excute JS code inside
**Where:** before `</body>` 1. inside a `<script>`  2.in an external file with a src attribute.
**Environment Setup:** Visual Studio, Atom, SublimeText.\
*Extentions for VS:* Live Server, Material Icon, Material Theme, intelliCode
**Variables:** Avoid var. use let or const
*let vs const:* let is mutable and can be changed later on. changing a const will cause TypeError
**Comments:** `//` for one line and `/* ... */` for mulyiple lines
**Naming Conventions:** camelcase, no reserved names, 
**Data Types:** string, boolean, number, null, undefined, object (arrays, date...), symbol 
**Strings:**  strings are immutable, which means that the original string itself cannot be modified. you can create string with: 1. `"..."` : you can include a `'` inside     2. `'...'`    3.`backtick`: you can include variables and multi lines string. 
*length:* you can have access to the string's length by accesing the length property of the string:  `string_variable.length` 
*String Methods:* since string are immutable, all the string methods are not destructives, they don't change the original string, they return a new one
indexOf(): return the location of the letter x. for example: "Hello". "Hello".indexOf("l") will return 2. return -1 if the letter was not found
lastIndexOf(): return the last location of the letter x. "Hello".lastIndexOf("l") will return 3.\
replace(): replace only the first occurence of a letter/s in a string. has 2 arguments. what you want to replace and with what as a second argument.  "balon-blue-sky".replace("-", " ") will return "balon blue-sky".\
replaceAll(): will replace all the occurences in a given word. "balon-blue-sky".replaceAll("-", " ") will return "balon blue sky".\
substring(): will take two index arguments: start and end (until which index), the end position is not included.\
slice(): the same as substring(). the key difference lies in how they handle negative indices and out-of-range indices.
diffrence:\
+ start > end: substring will swap the values, slice will return an empty string "encyclopedia".substring(5, 3) returns "yc" "encyclopedia".slice(5, 3
returns ""
+   if one argument is negative or is NaN, substring() will treat as if it were 0. slice() wil lreturn an empty string.\
startsWith(): return true if the string start with the argument "start".startsWith("t") will return false
endsWith(): return true if the string end with the argument "start".endsWith("t") will return true
include(): return true if the argument are found inside the string  "start".endsWith("t") will return true
