Yes, it is possible to configure your Windows system to automatically push to a Git repository before every shutdown. You can achieve this by creating a script and setting it to run on shutdown through the Task Scheduler. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Create a Script

1. **Create a Batch Script**: Create a `.bat` file (e.g., `git_push_on_shutdown.bat`) with the following content. Adjust the paths and Git commands as needed for your specific repository and setup.

    ```batch
    @echo off
    cd C:\path\to\your\git\repo
    git add .
    git commit -m "Auto-commit before shutdown"
    git push origin main
    ```

2. **Save the Script**: Save this file to a known location, e.g., `C:\scripts\git_push_on_shutdown.bat`.

### Step 2: Create a Task in Task Scheduler

1. **Open Task Scheduler**: Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter.

2. **Create a New Task**:
    - Click on `Create Task` in the Actions panel.
    - Give the task a name, e.g., "Git Push on Shutdown".

3. **Set Triggers**:
    - Go to the `Triggers` tab.
    - Click `New`.
    - In the `Begin the task` dropdown, select `On an event`.
    - Set the Log to `System`, Source to `User32`, and Event ID to `1074`.
    - Click `OK`.

4. **Set Actions**:
    - Go to the `Actions` tab.
    - Click `New`.
    - Set Action to `Start a program`.
    - Browse to your `.bat` file, e.g., `C:\scripts\git_push_on_shutdown.bat`.
    - Click `OK`.

5. **Configure Settings**:
    - Go to the `Conditions` tab and make sure that "Start only if the computer is on AC power" is unchecked if you want this to run on battery as well.
    - Go to the `Settings` tab and configure any additional settings as needed.

6. **Save the Task**:
    - Click `OK` to save the task.

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. **Manually Run the Task**: Right-click on the task in Task Scheduler and select `Run` to ensure it works as expected.
2. **Shutdown the Computer**: Perform a normal shutdown to see if the task triggers as expected.

### Notes

- Ensure that your Git repository is correctly configured with the necessary credentials to allow the script to push changes without requiring manual input.
- Test the script thoroughly to make sure it works correctly and handles potential errors (e.g., no changes to commit, network issues, etc.).
- Consider using SSH keys or a credential manager for seamless authentication with Git.

By following these steps, you can automate the process of pushing to a Git repository before every shutdown on a Windows machine.
